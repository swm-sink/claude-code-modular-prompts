## üèóÔ∏è Orchestration Architecture

### Master Orchestrator Configuration
```yaml
Master_Orchestrator:
  name: "Deep-Discovery-Transformation-Master"
  
  responsibilities:
    - Load and validate claude.local.md state
    - Assess task risk levels dynamically
    - Spawn appropriate agent pools
    - Monitor parallel execution health
    - Coordinate phase transitions
    - Handle failure recovery
    - Validate phase completions
  
  state_management:
    primary: claude.local.md
    backup: .orchestration-checkpoint.json
    recovery: .orchestration-recovery.log
```

### Agent Pool Architecture
```yaml
Agent_Pools:
  
  Pool_1_Archival_Agents:
    size: 3
    tasks: [7-11]
    execution: "Sequential with validation"
    purpose: "Complete Phase 1 archival"
    
  Pool_2_Builder_Brigade:
    size: 10
    tasks: [25-69]
    execution: "Parallel aggressive"
    purpose: "Create new infrastructure"
    
  Pool_3_Update_Specialists:
    size: 5
    tasks: [12-24, 70-80, 88-94]
    execution: "Risk-based mixed"
    purpose: "Update existing files"
    
  Pool_4_Cleanup_Crew:
    size: 4
    tasks: [81-87, 95-104]

```

## üîí Safety Mechanisms

### Conflict Prevention
```yaml
Resource_Locking:
  claude_local_md:
    lock_type: advisory
    lock_duration: task_completion
    
  CLAUDE_md:
    lock_type: exclusive
    approval_required: true
    
  new_files:
    lock_type: none_needed
    conflict_free: true
```

### Failure Recovery
```yaml
Recovery_Protocol:
  checkpoint_frequency: every_5_tasks
  
  on_failure:
    1. Capture failure details
    2. Rollback current task
    3. Update claude.local.md
    4. Alert orchestrator
    5. Reassign or escalate
    
  rollback_strategy:
    git_based: "Revert to last checkpoint"
    file_based: "Restore from .backup/"
```

### Validation Gates
```yaml
Phase_Validation_Gates:
  after_stage_1:
    - Archive complete
    - No integration files in active
    
  after_stage_2:
    - CLAUDE.md reflects generation vision
    - All docs created
    
  after_stage_3:
    - .claude-architect/ fully built
    - All agents defined
    
  after_stage_4:
    - Commands updated
    - Tests passing
    
  after_stage_5:
    - No integration references
    - Final validation complete
```

## üìà Performance Optimizations

### Template Reuse System
```yaml
Template_Library:
  agent_template:
    base: ".claude-architect/templates/AGENT-BASE.md"
    customization_points: [specialization, expertise, boundaries]
    
  command_template:
    base: ".claude-architect/templates/COMMAND-BASE.md"
    customization_points: [name, description, usage]
    
  test_template:
    base: "tests/templates/TEST-BASE.sh"
    customization_points: [test_name, validation_logic]
```

### Parallel Execution Optimization
```yaml
Parallel_Strategies:
  work_distribution:
    by_directory: "Agents claim entire directories"
    by_file_type: "Agents specialize in file types"
    by_complexity: "Simple tasks to fast agents"
    
  communication_optimization:
    batch_updates: "Update claude.local.md every 5 tasks"
    async_validation: "Validate while others continue"
    pipeline_approach: "Start next phase before previous completes"
```
