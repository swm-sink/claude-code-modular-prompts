## 🔄 PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE MECHANICS

### **How Users Move Between Layers:**

#### **Discovery Path (Organic):**
```markdown
# User starts in Layer 1
User: /quick-command search "find API calls"
System: "✅ Created /find-api-calls. Try it: /find-api-calls
         💡 Want more control? Try: /build-command search 'find API calls' --customize"

# User tries Layer 2 when they need more
User: /build-command search "find API calls" --customize
System: Shows 3-5 customization options
User: Customizes and gets better result

# User discovers Layer 3 when they need maximum power
System: "🔧 Need even more control? Try: /assemble-command --interactive for full component access"
```

#### **Direct Access (Explicit):**
```bash
# Users can directly choose their layer
/quick-command     # Layer 1: Auto-generation
/build-command     # Layer 2: Guided customization  
/assemble-command  # Layer 3: Full assembly
```

#### **Smart Recommendations:**
```python
# System suggests appropriate layer based on user patterns
def recommend_layer(user_history, current_request):
    if user_history.successful_with_layer1 and simple_request(current_request):
        return "layer1"  # Keep it simple
    elif user_history.customization_attempts > 3:
        return "layer2"  # They want control
    elif user_history.component_usage > 0:
        return "layer3"  # They're ready for power
    else:
        return "layer1"  # Default to simplicity
```

### **Layer Transition Safeguards:**

#### **Complexity Warnings:**
```markdown
# When moving to higher layers
"⚠️ You're entering Layer 2 (Guided Customization)
This requires understanding 3-5 concepts and takes 3-5 minutes.
Continue? (y/n) or stay simple with /quick-command"
```

#### **Fallback Options:**
```markdown
# Always provide simpler alternatives
"Having trouble with customization? 
Try: /quick-command search 'your description' for instant results"
```

#### **Success Validation:**
```python
# Check if user succeeded at their chosen layer
def validate_layer_success(layer, user_interaction):
    if layer == 1 and time_to_success > 60:
        suggest_help_or_simplification()
    elif layer == 2 and customization_attempts > 3:
        offer_layer1_alternative()
    elif layer == 3 and assembly_time > 30_minutes:
        suggest_layer2_guided_approach()
```
