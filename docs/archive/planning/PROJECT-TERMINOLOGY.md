# PROJECT TERMINOLOGY - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

## üéØ **DRY PRINCIPLE: Centralized Terminology Management**

**Purpose**: Prevent future massive cleanup efforts by maintaining a single source of truth for all project terminology.

### **OFFICIAL PROJECT TERMINOLOGY**

| Category | Official Term | Never Use |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Project Name** | Claude Context Architect | Claude Code Modular Prompts |
| **Project Type** | Context Engineering System | Template Library, Prompt Engineering Framework |
| **Core Process** | Interactive Consultation System | Progressive Disclosure |
| **Agent System** | Specialized Agent System | Component Library |
| **Methodology** | Context Engineering | Prompt Engineering |
| **Context Files** | Context Engineering Patterns | Template Components |
| **Commands** | Context-Aware Commands | Command Templates |
| **Architecture** | Context Engineering Architecture | Template Library Architecture |

### **APPROVED CONTEXT PATTERNS**

**‚úÖ CORRECT LANGUAGE:**
- "30+ minute interactive consultation"
- "Specialized context engineering agents"
- "Multi-file hierarchical context system"
- "Deep project intelligence extraction"
- "Context effectiveness validation"
- "Project-specific context understanding"

**‚ùå DEPRECATED LANGUAGE:**
- "Progressive disclosure system"
- "Template library management"
- "Component library access"
- "Prompt engineering patterns"
- "Command template customization"

### **ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL**

**Before ANY content creation:**
1. **Reference this file** for correct terminology
2. **Validate** that new content uses approved language
3. **Update** this file if new concepts emerge
4. **Cross-reference** related documentation

### **FUTURE CLEANUP PREVENTION**

**DRY Implementation:**
- **Single Source**: This file defines all terminology
- **Validation Scripts**: Automated checks reference this file
- **Documentation Standards**: All docs must align with this terminology
- **Review Process**: All changes must validate against this file

### **SYSTEMATIC REPLACEMENT RULES**

When updating any document, apply these systematic replacements:

```bash
# Core terminology updates
sed -i 's/template library/context engineering system/g' file.md
sed -i 's/progressive disclosure/interactive consultation system/g' file.md
sed -i 's/component library/specialized agent system/g' file.md
sed -i 's/prompt engineering/context engineering/g' file.md
sed -i 's/Claude Code Modular Prompts/Claude Context Architect/g' file.md
```

### **QUALITY GATES**

**Before any commit:**
- [ ] All content uses approved terminology from this file
- [ ] No deprecated language appears in modified files
- [ ] New concepts are added to this file if introduced
- [ ] Related documentation is updated for consistency

**This file serves as the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all project terminology to prevent future massive cleanup efforts.**
