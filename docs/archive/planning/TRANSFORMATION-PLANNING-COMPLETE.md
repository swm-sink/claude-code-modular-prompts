# Transformation Planning Complete Status Report

## Planning Phase: COMPLETE âœ… (Updated for Dual-Purpose)

### Executive Summary
All documentation required for the dual-purpose transformation of the Claude Code Modular Prompts project has been created. The transformation addresses two stages:
1. **Stage 1**: Transform THIS project into a context engineering framework (6 weeks)
2. **Stage 2**: Function as a git submodule for OTHER projects (ongoing)

The AI assistant implementing this transformation has **everything needed** to succeed in both stages.

## Conclusion

**The dual-purpose transformation planning phase is 100% COMPLETE.**

The transformation addresses two critical stages:
- **Stage 1**: Transform THIS project from prompt library to framework (6 weeks)
- **Stage 2**: Enable framework to function as git submodule for OTHER projects (ongoing)

The next step is to begin implementation by:
1. Understanding TWO-STAGE-TRANSFORMATION-COMPLEXITY.md
2. Creating `.transformation/` directory structure
3. Creating transformation agents
4. Following MIGRATION-STRATEGY.md Day 1
5. Executing Phase -1 context engineering
6. Tracking progress daily with dual-mode awareness

No additional planning is required. The dual-purpose implementation can begin immediately.
