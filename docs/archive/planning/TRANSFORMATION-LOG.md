# Claude Context Architect - Transformation Log

## Overview
Daily progress tracking for the transformation from Claude Context Architect to Research-Driven Context Engineering System.

---

## Week 1: Analysis and Research Infrastructure

### Day 1 - Project Analysis
**Date**: [TBD]
**Phase**: 0 - Analysis and Cleanup

**Completed**:
- [ ] Created TRANSFORMATION-PLAN.md with complete 6-week roadmap
- [ ] Analyzed project structure and identified transformation requirements
- [ ] Set up transformation tracking system

**In Progress**:
- [ ] Inventory of all 88 commands
- [ ] Analysis of 96 components for reusable patterns

**Blockers**:
- None

**Notes**:
- Project contains mix of well-documented patterns and aspirational features
- Need to separate verified content from unverified claims
- Anti-pattern documentation is valuable and should be preserved

---

### Day 2 - Directory Restructuring
**Date**: [TBD]
**Phase**: 0 - Analysis and Cleanup

**Planned**:
- [ ] Create new directory structure
- [ ] Move verified content to appropriate locations
- [ ] Archive unverified/aspirational content
- [ ] Set up git submodule structure

**Success Criteria**:
- Clean separation of scaffolding vs patterns
- Git submodule ready structure
- All verified content preserved

---

### Day 3 - Research Infrastructure
**Date**: [TBD]
**Phase**: 1 - Research Infrastructure

**Planned**:
- [ ] Create research command templates
- [ ] Build web search query patterns
- [ ] Design source validation checklist
- [ ] Implement VERIFY protocol

**Success Criteria**:
- Research commands can find authoritative sources
- Verification prevents hallucination
- Evidence tracking operational

---

## Week 2: Core Command System

### Day 6 - Phase 0 Commands
**Date**: [TBD]
**Phase**: 2 - Command Implementation

**Planned**:
- [ ] Create 0_verify-environment.md
- [ ] Create 0_verify-project.md
- [ ] Create 0_verify-repository.md

## Risk Log

### Active Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Need to maintain focus on 30 commands
   - Status: Monitoring
   - Mitigation: Strict phase boundaries in plan

---

## Decision Log

### Key Decisions Made
1. **30 Commands vs 88**: Reduced to essential scaffolding commands
   - Rationale: Simpler, clearer user experience
   - Date: [Analysis phase]

2. **Research-First Approach**: Every pattern must have sources
   - Rationale: Prevent hallucination and ensure quality
   - Date: [Analysis phase]

3. **60+ Minute Setup**: Thorough over quick
   - Rationale: Quality context engineering takes time
   - Date: [Analysis phase]

## Next Actions
1. Complete command inventory spreadsheet
2. Begin directory restructuring
3. Create first research command template
