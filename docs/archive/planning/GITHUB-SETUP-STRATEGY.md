## üö® CRITICAL SUCCESS STEPS

### **Step 1: Repository Setup** (30 minutes)
1. Create new GitHub repository `claude-context-architect`
2. Set up branch protection rules for `main`
3. Add all labels using GitHub CLI or web interface
4. Create all 6 milestones with due dates
5. Upload master plan document as README reference

### **Step 2: Issue Template Creation** (45 minutes)
1. Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
2. Create individual markdown files for each T#.## task
3. Use standard template format with specific details for each task
4. Include all context file references and validation criteria

### **Step 3: Batch Issue Creation** (60 minutes)
1. Create all Phase 0 issues first (T0.01 - T0.19)
2. Add dependency relationships between issues
3. Assign to appropriate milestones and labels
4. Set up project board with automation rules

### **Step 4: Validation Setup** (30 minutes)
1. Create GitHub Actions for issue validation
2. Set up progress tracking automation
3. Create initial project board with all issues
4. Test workflow with first few issues

### **Step 5: Launch Phase 0** (15 minutes)
1. Move T0.01 to "Ready" column
2. Begin first task execution
3. Validate that tracking and automation work correctly
4. Adjust templates and processes based on initial experience

## üéØ AVOIDING ITERATION - CRITICAL CHECKPOINTS

### **Before Issue Creation**
- [ ] All task descriptions are truly atomic and measurable
- [ ] Every deliverable has specific validation criteria
- [ ] All context file references are planned and logical
- [ ] Dependencies between tasks are clearly defined
- [ ] Time estimates are realistic based on task complexity

### **During Execution**
- [ ] Issue completion requires ALL checkboxes checked
- [ ] Context file references must be valid before closing
- [ ] Validation criteria must be met with evidence
- [ ] Next task dependencies automatically become "Ready"
- [ ] Progress tracking updates automatically

### **Quality Gates**
- **Phase 0**: No template library references remain anywhere
- **Phase 1**: All architecture documents cross-reference correctly
- **Phase 2**: Every agent has been individually tested and validated
- **Phase 3**: Full consultation workflow works end-to-end
- **Phase 4**: Multi-project testing passes all scenarios
- **Phase 5**: Community launch ready with complete documentation

This GitHub setup strategy ensures maximum success by providing clear tracking, atomic task management, automated validation, and comprehensive progress visibility throughout the Claude Context Architect development process.
