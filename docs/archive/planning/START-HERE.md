# START HERE: Beginning the Transformation

## Immediate First Steps (Day 1)

### 1. Review Transformation Documents
Read in this order:
1. `TRANSFORMATION-SUMMARY.md` - Overview of what we're building
2. `TRANSFORMATION-PLAN.md` - Complete 6-week roadmap
3. `ANTIPATTERN-PREVENTION-GUIDE.md` - What to avoid
4. `COMMAND-TEMPLATE-EXAMPLE.md` - How new commands work

### 2. Set Up Working Environment
```bash
# Create working branch
git checkout -b context-engineering-transformation

# Create analysis directory
mkdir -p analysis

# Start command inventory
touch analysis/command-inventory.csv
touch analysis/component-inventory.csv
```

### 3. Create AI Agent Orchestration System (NEW - Critical for Phase -1)
```bash
# Create agents directory
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# Create context engineering foundation directories
mkdir -p .claude/{context,domains,examples,indexes,memory}
mkdir -p .claude/context/claude-code
mkdir -p .claude/domains/{technical,business,operations}
mkdir -p .claude/examples/{backend,frontend,integration}
```

Create the 6 orchestration agents:
1. **transformation-orchestrator.md** - Master coordinator
2. **context-engineer.md** - Context structure specialist  
3. **command-builder.md** - Command generation
4. **research-validator.md** - Evidence validation
5. **quality-guardian.md** - Anti-pattern prevention
6. **memory-keeper.md** - Decision tracking

Each agent needs:
- YAML frontmatter with name, description, tools
- Context loading specification
- Core responsibilities
- Integration patterns

See `CLAUDE-CODE-AGENT-ORCHESTRATION-PLAN.md` for complete templates.

### 4. Begin Command Analysis
Open `analysis/command-inventory.csv` and add headers:
```csv
Command Name,Category,Core Pattern,Reusable (Y/N),Evidence Source Needed,Transformation Notes
```

Start with first 10 commands from `.claude/commands/core/`

### 5. Create New Directory Structure
```bash
# Run these commands to create the new structure
mkdir -p .claude-context/{scaffolding,patterns,research,vetted-context,validation,templates}
mkdir -p .claude-context/scaffolding/{0_verify,1_research,2_context,3_agent,4_command,5_integrate,6_team,7_maintain}
mkdir -p .claude-context/patterns/{workflow,analysis,generation,testing,security,performance}
mkdir -p .claude-context/research/{templates,queries,sources,evidence}
mkdir -p .claude-context/vetted-context/{antipatterns,best-practices,claude-code-research}
```

### 6. Preserve Vetted Content
Copy verified anti-patterns to new structure:
```bash
cp .claude/context/llm-antipatterns.md .claude-context/vetted-context/antipatterns/
cp .claude/context/git-history-antipatterns.md .claude-context/vetted-context/antipatterns/
cp .claude/context/comprehensive-project-learnings.md .claude-context/vetted-context/antipatterns/
```

### 7. Create First Research Template
Create `.claude-context/research/templates/web-search-template.md`:
```markdown
# Web Search Template

## Search Queries
- "[TOPIC] best practices 2024 site:official-docs"
- "[TOPIC] patterns github stars:>1000"
- "[TOPIC] anti-patterns production"

## Source Evaluation
- [ ] Official documentation?
- [ ] Recognized expert?
- [ ] Recent (2023-2024)?
- [ ] Real examples provided?
- [ ] Community validation?

## Evidence Format
Pattern: [Name]
Source: [URL]
Authority: [Score /10]
Evidence: [Specific quote or example]
```

### 8. Update Daily Log
Open `TRANSFORMATION-LOG.md` and record:
- What you completed today
- Any blockers encountered
- Tomorrow's priorities

## Week 1 Priorities

1. **Complete inventory** of all commands and components
2. **Identify top 20 patterns** to transform first
3. **Build VERIFY protocol** tools
4. **Create first research command** (1_research-domain)
5. **Test research process** with one domain

## Success Indicators

You're on track if by end of Week 1 you have:
- ✓ Complete inventory of what exists
- ✓ New directory structure in place
- ✓ Vetted content preserved
- ✓ First research command working
- ✓ Clear plan for Week 2

## Questions to Answer

As you analyze the existing commands:
1. Which patterns appear most frequently?
2. Which commands are most valuable to preserve?
3. What evidence would validate these patterns?
4. Which anti-patterns keep appearing?
5. What's truly tested vs aspirational?

## Remember the Core Principle

**Every pattern needs evidence.** If you can't find authoritative sources for something, it doesn't go in the new system. Better to have 30 well-researched patterns than 100 made-up ones.

## Daily Checklist

- [ ] Morning: Review plan and yesterday's progress
- [ ] Work: Follow VERIFY protocol for all decisions
- [ ] Document: Update logs and tracking sheets
- [ ] Evening: Plan tomorrow's priorities
- [ ] Commit: Push all changes with clear messages
