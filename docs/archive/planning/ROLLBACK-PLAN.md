# Rollback Plan

## Overview
This document outlines procedures for reverting the transformation if critical issues arise.

## Rollback Triggers

### Severity Levels

#### Level 1: Minor Issues (No Rollback)
- Individual command failures
- Documentation typos
- Minor performance degradation
- Non-critical bug reports

**Action**: Fix forward, no rollback needed

#### Level 2: Major Issues (Partial Rollback)
- Multiple command failures
- Integration breaking
- Performance targets missed by >20%
- Security vulnerability found

**Action**: Rollback affected components only

#### Level 3: Critical Issues (Full Rollback)
- System completely broken
- Data loss occurring
- Security breach active
- >50% commands failing
- User revolt

**Action**: Full rollback to v1.0

## Rollback Procedures

### Pre-Rollback Checklist
- [ ] Document the issue thoroughly
- [ ] Capture current state for debugging
- [ ] Notify stakeholders
- [ ] Prepare rollback announcement
- [ ] Ensure backup available

### Partial Rollback (Level 2)

```bash
# 1. Identify affected components
git log --oneline --grep="[component]"

# 2. Revert specific commits
git revert [commit-hash]

# 3. Or restore specific files from v1.0
git checkout v1.0-pre-transformation -- .claude/commands/[specific-command]

# 4. Test the partial rollback
/0_verify-environment
/5_validate-setup

# 5. Document what was rolled back
echo "Partial rollback performed on $(date)" >> ROLLBACK-LOG.md
echo "Affected components: [list]" >> ROLLBACK-LOG.md
echo "Reason: [detailed reason]" >> ROLLBACK-LOG.md

# 6. Commit with clear message
git commit -m "rollback: Revert [component] due to [issue]"
```

### Full Rollback (Level 3)

```bash
# 1. Stop all work immediately
echo "TRANSFORMATION HALTED - CRITICAL ISSUE" > STOP-WORK-NOTICE.md

# 2. Create rollback branch
git checkout -b emergency-rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 3. Full restoration from tag
git checkout v1.0-pre-transformation
git checkout -b v1.0-restored

# 4. Preserve any valuable work
git checkout context-engineering-transformation -- .transformation-logs/
git checkout context-engineering-transformation -- .research-findings/

# 5. Update repository state
echo "# ROLLBACK NOTICE" > README-ROLLBACK.md
echo "Transformation rolled back on $(date)" >> README-ROLLBACK.md
echo "Reason: [critical issue description]" >> README-ROLLBACK.md
echo "See ROLLBACK-POSTMORTEM.md for details" >> README-ROLLBACK.md

# 6. Tag the rollback
git tag -a "rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d)" -m "Emergency rollback due to [reason]"

# 7. Push everything
git push origin v1.0-restored
git push origin --tags
```

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
```markdown
Subject: Transformation Rollback - [Level]

Team,

We are initiating a [partial/full] rollback due to [issue].

Impact:
- [Affected components]
- [User impact]
- [Timeline]

Action Required:
- Stop work on [areas]
- Focus on [priorities]
- Stand by for updates

[Contact] is leading the rollback.
```

### External Communication
```markdown
Subject: Important Update - Claude Code Context Engineering System

Users,

We've discovered [issue] with the new system and are reverting to ensure stability.

What this means:
- [Impact on users]
- [What still works]
- [Timeline for resolution]

Your data is safe and existing setups continue to work.

We apologize for any inconvenience and will share updates at [location].

[Sign-off]
```

## Post-Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Actions (Hour 1)
1. Verify rollback successful
2. Test critical functionality
3. Monitor for issues
4. Send communications
5. Begin postmortem

### Short-term Actions (Day 1)
1. Complete postmortem document
2. Identify root cause
3. Plan fix approach
4. Update stakeholders
5. Create fixed timeline

### Recovery Planning (Week 1)
1. Fix identified issues
2. Enhance testing for gap
3. Plan re-deployment
4. Strengthen procedures
5. Document lessons learned

## Rollback Postmortem Template

```markdown
# Rollback Postmortem - [Date]

## Summary
- **Level**: [1/2/3]
- **Duration**: [start time] to [end time]
- **Impact**: [user impact summary]
- **Root Cause**: [brief description]

## Timeline
- [Time]: Issue first noticed
- [Time]: Decision to rollback
- [Time]: Rollback initiated
- [Time]: Rollback completed
- [Time]: Service restored

## What Went Wrong
[Detailed technical explanation]

## What Went Right
[Things that worked well during rollback]

## Root Cause Analysis
[5 Whys or similar analysis]

## Lessons Learned
1. [Lesson with action item]
2. [Lesson with action item]
3. [Lesson with action item]

## Action Items
- [ ] [Specific fix with owner]
- [ ] [Process improvement with owner]
- [ ] [Testing enhancement with owner]

## Prevention
[How we'll prevent this in future]
```

## Rollback Testing

### Practice Scenarios
Run monthly rollback drills:

1. **Partial Rollback Drill**
   - Pretend Phase 3 commands failed
   - Practice reverting just those
   - Time the process
   - Document issues

2. **Full Rollback Drill**
   - Simulate critical failure
   - Run full procedure
   - Test communications
   - Measure recovery time

### Rollback Validation
After any rollback:
- [ ] All specified components reverted
- [ ] No unintended changes
- [ ] System functional
- [ ] Users notified
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Lessons captured

## Recovery Metrics

### Success Criteria for Re-Deployment
Before attempting transformation again:
- [ ] Root cause fixed and tested
- [ ] Additional safeguards in place
- [ ] Enhanced testing coverage
- [ ] Stakeholder confidence restored
- [ ] Clear success metrics defined
- [ ] Rollback plan improved

### Go/No-Go Decision Matrix
| Criteria | Required | Actual | Go/No-Go |
|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| Tests Passing | 100% | _% | |
| Performance Met | Yes | | |
| Security Clean | Yes | | |
| User Acceptance | >80% | _% | |
| Team Confidence | High | | |

## Maintaining Two Versions

During transformation period:
```bash
# Keep both versions functional
git worktree add ../claude-v1 v1.0-maintenance
git worktree add ../claude-v2 context-engineering-transformation

# Cherry-pick critical fixes to both
git cherry-pick [fix-commit]

# Tag stable points
git tag -a "v1.0.1-stable" -m "Pre-transformation stable"
git tag -a "v2.0-beta1" -m "Transformation beta"
```

## Final Notes

- **Rollback is not failure** - it's responsible engineering
- **User stability** > transformation timeline
- **Document everything** - future you will thank you
- **Practice makes perfect** - drill the procedures
- **Learn and improve** - each issue makes us stronger

Remember: A successful rollback that protects users is better than pushing through with problems.
