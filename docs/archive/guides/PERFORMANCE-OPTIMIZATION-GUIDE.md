# Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview
This guide ensures the Research-Driven Context Engineering System operates efficiently within Claude Code's constraints.

## Token Usage Optimization

### Current Baseline (v1.0)
```yaml
Average Command Size: 1,200 tokens
Context Load: 180,000 tokens
Efficiency: 60%
Waste: 40% redundant/unused content
```

### Target Metrics (v2.0)
```yaml
Average Command Size: 800 tokens
Context Load: 100,000 tokens  
Efficiency: 85%
Waste: <15% redundant content
```

### Token Reduction Strategies

#### 1. Command Compression
```markdown
❌ BEFORE: Verbose explanation
"When implementing this pattern, you should carefully consider 
the various implications and potential ramifications of your 
architectural decisions, taking into account..."

✅ AFTER: Concise instruction
"Consider architectural impact when implementing."
```

#### 2. Reference Instead of Repeat
```markdown
❌ BEFORE: Duplicating instructions
Command A: [500 tokens of search instructions]
Command B: [500 tokens of same search instructions]

✅ AFTER: Single source of truth
Shared: research/SEARCH-PROTOCOL.md [500 tokens]
Command A: See SEARCH-PROTOCOL.md [10 tokens]
Command B: See SEARCH-PROTOCOL.md [10 tokens]
```

#### 3. Smart Context Loading
```yaml
# Context priority system
Priority 1 (Always Load): 8k tokens
  - Core behavioral rules
  - Active command definitions
  - Current workflow state

Priority 2 (Task-Specific): 50k tokens
  - Relevant patterns only
  - Framework-specific rules
  - Domain knowledge

Priority 3 (Reference): 40k tokens
  - Examples and templates
  - Detailed documentation
  - Historical context
```

## Search Performance Optimization

### Query Efficiency
```yaml
# Inefficient: Broad searches
❌ "best practices" - Returns millions of results

# Efficient: Specific searches
✅ "react hooks best practices 2024 site:react.dev"
✅ "typescript strict mode configuration official docs"
✅ "jest testing patterns kent c dodds"
```

### Search Caching Strategy
```markdown
.claude-context/research/cache/
├── domains/
│   ├── web-dev.cache.json
│   ├── fintech.cache.json
│   └── [domain].cache.json
├── frameworks/
│   ├── react.cache.json
│   ├── django.cache.json
│   └── [framework].cache.json
└── cache-manifest.json

Cache Entry Format:
{
  "query": "exact search query",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "ttl": 604800,  // 1 week in seconds
  "results": [...],
  "quality_score": 0.92
}
```

### Parallel Search Execution
```yaml
# Sequential (Slow): 25 seconds
Search 1: 5s → Search 2: 5s → Search 3: 5s → Process: 10s

# Parallel (Fast): 15 seconds  
Search 1 ┐
Search 2 ├→ 5s → Process: 10s
Search 3 ┘
```

## Command Execution Optimization

### Lazy Loading Pattern
```yaml
# Don't load everything upfront
❌ Load all patterns → Show menu → User selects one

# Load only what's needed
✅ Show menu → User selects → Load specific pattern
```

### Progressive Enhancement
```yaml
Phase 0 (Instant): Basic verification
  - Quick environment check
  - No file scanning
  - <2 second response

Phase 1 (Fast): Targeted research  
  - 5 specific searches
  - Cached when possible
  - <15 second response

Phase 2 (Thorough): Deep analysis
  - Full codebase scan
  - Comprehensive patterns
  - <60 second response
```

## File System Optimization

### Efficient File Operations
```bash
# Inefficient: Multiple reads
❌ Read package.json for name
❌ Read package.json for version
❌ Read package.json for dependencies

# Efficient: Single read, multiple extractions
✅ Read package.json once → Extract all needed data
```

### Directory Structure for Performance
```yaml
Shallow Structure (Fast):
.claude-context/
├── scaffolding/[phase]/[command].md  # 2 levels

Deep Structure (Slow):
.claude/commands/categories/subcategories/types/[command].md  # 5 levels
```

### Index Files for Quick Access
```markdown
# .claude-context/INDEX.md
Quick access to all commands:

Phase 0 - Verification
- [0_verify-environment](scaffolding/0_verify/environment.md)
- [0_verify-project](scaffolding/0_verify/project.md)

Phase 1 - Research  
[... direct links to all commands ...]
```

## Memory Management

### Context Window Budget
```yaml
Total Budget: 200,000 tokens

Allocation:
- System Prompt: 15,000 tokens (7.5%)
- Command Definitions: 25,000 tokens (12.5%)
- Active Context: 100,000 tokens (50%)
- Working Memory: 40,000 tokens (20%)
- Safety Buffer: 20,000 tokens (10%)
```

### Garbage Collection Pattern
```markdown
After each phase completion:
1. Clear phase-specific context
2. Compress completed work
3. Archive detailed logs
4. Keep only summary

Example:
- During Phase 1: Full research data (50k tokens)
- After Phase 1: Research summary (5k tokens)
```

## Anti-Pattern Performance Costs

### Expensive Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### 1. Unbounded Searches
```yaml
❌ Cost: 30+ seconds, inconsistent results
Pattern: Open-ended web searches
Fix: Specific, bounded queries
```

#### 2. Redundant Validation
```yaml
❌ Cost: 2x execution time
Pattern: Validating the same thing multiple times
Fix: Validate once, cache result
```

#### 3. Deep Recursion
```yaml
❌ Cost: Exponential token growth
Pattern: Commands calling commands calling commands
Fix: Maximum 2-level command chains
```

#### 4. Context Bloat
```yaml
❌ Cost: Slow responses, confusion
Pattern: Loading everything "just in case"
Fix: Load only what's needed
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
```yaml
Per Command:
- Token usage (target: <800)
- Execution time (target: varies by phase)
- Search queries (target: <10)
- File operations (target: <5)

Per Session:
- Total tokens (target: <150k)
- Commands run (target: <30)
- Time to complete (target: <90 min)
- Cache hit rate (target: >30%)
```

## Final Performance Principles

1. **Measure First**: Don't optimize without data
2. **User Experience**: Fast enough > fastest possible
3. **Maintainability**: Clear code > clever code
4. **Realistic Goals**: Work within Claude Code limits
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Small gains compound

Remember: A system that completes in 60 minutes with high quality beats one that fails fast in 10 minutes.
