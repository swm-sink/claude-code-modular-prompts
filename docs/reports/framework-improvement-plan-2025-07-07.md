## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Days 1-2)

#### 1.1 Version Consistency Fix
**Issue**: #133  
**Problem**: swarm.md shows v2.4.0 while framework expects v2.3.0  
**Solution**: Update version table in swarm.md to match framework version  
**Impact**: Resolves test failures and validation errors  

#### 1.2 Git Worktree Implementation
**Issue**: #134  
**Problem**: Documented but not implemented worktree isolation  
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Implementation pattern
git worktree add -b agent-{id} .worktrees/{agent-id} HEAD
cd .worktrees/{agent-id}
# Execute Task() with isolation
git merge agent-{id} --no-ff
git worktree remove .worktrees/{agent-id}
```
**Impact**: Enables true multi-agent isolation

#### 1.3 Integration Agent Module
**Issue**: #135  
**Problem**: No cross-component validation  
**Solution**: Create integration agent in `.claude/modules/patterns/integration-agent.md`
- Monitor agent communications
- Validate interface contracts
- Test integration points
- Provide health metrics

#### 1.4 TDD Compliance Enforcement
**Issue**: #136  
**Problem**: Agents skip RED phase, write code before tests  
**Solution**: 
- Strengthen task module enforcement
- Add pre-implementation validation
- Track TDD cycle completion
- Create compliance metrics

### Phase 2: Quality Improvements (Days 3-7)

#### 2.1 Test Coverage Expansion
**Issue**: #137  
**Current**: 8 files, 44 functions  
**Target**: 90%+ coverage  
**New Tests**:
- Performance benchmarks
- Security validation
- Integration scenarios
- Error recovery paths
- TDD compliance checks

#### 2.2 Real-Time Quality Monitoring
**Issue**: #138  
**Features**:
- Continuous metrics collection
- Performance degradation detection
- Predictive quality scoring
- Automated alert system
- Self-healing triggers

#### 2.3 Context Optimization
**Issue**: #139  
**Goals**:
- Reduce token usage by 40%
- Implement smart context loading
- Add relevance-based pruning
- Create token analytics dashboard

#### 2.4 Module Refactoring
**Issue**: #140  
**Targets**:
- intelligent-routing.md (1119 → <700 lines)
- pattern-library.md (1450 → <700 lines)
- error-recovery.md (1393 → <700 lines)

### Phase 3: Strategic Enhancements (Weeks 2-3)

#### 3.1 Performance Optimization
- Implement comprehensive benchmarks
- Optimize critical paths
- Add caching strategies
- Improve parallel execution

#### 3.2 Automated Compliance
- Build compliance verification system
- Automate quality gate checks
- Create compliance dashboard
- Generate compliance reports

### Phase 4: Long-term Goals (Weeks 4-8)

#### 4.1 Self-Healing Framework
- Design recovery patterns
- Implement auto-remediation
- Create healing metrics
- Build resilience testing

#### 4.2 AI-Driven Optimization
- Develop module composition AI
- Implement learning algorithms
- Create optimization metrics
- Build adaptive system
