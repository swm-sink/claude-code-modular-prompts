## Integration Status

### Command Integration
All commands now enforce quality gates with non-bypassable blocking:

- **`/task`**: Updated with mandatory TDD checkpoints and quality gate verification
- **`/feature`**: Integrated comprehensive quality gates throughout feature workflow
- **`/swarm`**: Added multi-agent quality coordination with cross-agent verification

### Module Integration
Core modules updated to leverage quality gate system:

- **`task-management.md`**: Integrated all new quality gate modules with blocking enforcement
- **`feature-workflow.md`**: Updated quality gates with comprehensive verification
- **`multi-agent.md`**: Added swarm-level quality assurance and enforcement gates

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Non-Bypassable Blocking
- 🚫 **TDD Violations**: Prevent commit until RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle complete
- 🚫 **Security Threats**: Block deployment until threats mitigated
- 🚫 **Performance Regressions**: Prevent merge until benchmarks met
- 🚫 **Quality Gate Failures**: Block completion until all gates pass

### Evidence Collection
- 📊 **TDD Evidence**: Complete RED-GREEN-REFACTOR proof with timestamps
- 🔒 **Security Evidence**: Threat models, scan results, mitigation verification
- ⚡ **Performance Evidence**: Benchmark results, regression analysis, optimization reports
- 📋 **Compliance Evidence**: Quality certificates, audit trails, integrity verification

### Audit Trail
- 📁 **Structured Archives**: Evidence stored in organized directory structures
- 🕐 **Timestamped Logs**: All gate executions logged with immutable timestamps
- 🔍 **Integrity Verification**: Checksums and signatures prevent evidence tampering
- 📈 **Trend Analysis**: Quality metrics tracked over time for continuous improvement

## Quality Metrics

### Implementation Quality
