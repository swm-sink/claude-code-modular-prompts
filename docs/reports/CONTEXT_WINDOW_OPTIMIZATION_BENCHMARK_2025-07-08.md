Command Definition Example - /task Command:

Traditional Prose Format:
"The task command is designed to handle single-component development tasks using the RISE framework. It begins by defining the role that the AI should take, considering the expertise level required for the task. Then it analyzes the input requirements, conducting research to understand the existing codebase and dependencies. Next, it defines the implementation steps while ensuring TDD methodology is followed. After implementing the minimal code to pass tests, it refactors the code to meet quality standards. Finally, it validates that all expectations are met and quality gates are passed."
