# Contributing to Claude Code Template Library

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project thrives on community contributions, especially **adaptation patterns** that help others customize the templates for their specific use cases.

## ü§ù Types of Contributions We Welcome

### 1. **Adaptation Patterns** (Most Valuable!)
Share how you customized the templates for your specific project:
- Domain-specific adaptations (e.g., fintech, healthcare, e-commerce)
- Technology stack patterns (e.g., MEAN stack, JAMstack, serverless)
- Team size optimizations (solo developer vs. enterprise team)
- Workflow customizations (agile, DevOps, research-focused)

### 2. **Bug Reports**
Found an issue with the templates or documentation?
- Incorrect placeholders
- Broken command syntax
- Documentation errors
- Setup script issues

### 3. **Template Improvements**
Suggestions for better templates:
- New placeholders that would be useful
- Better command descriptions
- Improved prompt engineering patterns
- Additional examples

### 4. **New Command Templates**
Propose new commands that would benefit the community:
- Must be generic enough to adapt
- Should follow existing patterns
- Include proper placeholders

### 5. **Documentation Enhancements**
Help others understand and use the library:
- Clearer instructions
- Additional examples
- Video tutorials or guides
- Translation to other languages

## üìù How to Contribute

### Sharing an Adaptation Pattern

1. **Document Your Adaptation**
   Use the `/share-adaptation` command to generate a template:
   ```bash
   /share-adaptation
   ```
   This provides a structured format for documenting:
   - What placeholders you replaced
   - What values you used
   - Why you made specific choices
   - Any custom modifications

2. **Create an Adaptation File**
   Save your pattern as: `adaptations/[domain]-[stack]-pattern.md`
   
   Example: `adaptations/ecommerce-nodejs-pattern.md`
   ```markdown
   # E-commerce Node.js Adaptation Pattern
   
   ## Overview
   - **Domain**: E-commerce
   - **Stack**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, React
   - **Team Size**: 5-10 developers
   - **Special Requirements**: PCI compliance, real-time inventory
   
   ## Placeholder Mappings
   - `[INSERT_PROJECT_NAME]` ‚Üí "CommerceAPI"
   - `[INSERT_DOMAIN]` ‚Üí "e-commerce"
   - `[INSERT_TECH_STACK]` ‚Üí "Node.js/Express/PostgreSQL"
   - `[INSERT_COMPLIANCE_REQUIREMENTS]` ‚Üí "PCI-DSS"
   ...
   
   ## Custom Modifications
   - Added custom `/inventory-sync` command
   - Modified `/deploy` for blue-green deployments
   - Enhanced `/secure-assess` for PCI compliance
   
   ## Lessons Learned
   - Real-time features required WebSocket placeholders
   - Payment processing needed additional security commands
   ```

3. **Submit via GitHub**
   - Fork the repository
   - Add your adaptation file
   - Create a pull request with tag `adaptation-pattern`

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Check Existing Issues**
   Search [existing issues](https://github.com/swm-sink/claude-code-modular-prompts/issues) first

2. **Create Bug Report**
   Use this template:
   ```markdown
   **Describe the bug**
   Clear description of what's wrong
   
   **To Reproduce**
   1. Run command '...'
   2. See error
   
   **Expected behavior**
   What should happen instead
   
   **Environment**
   - OS: [e.g., macOS 13.0]
   - Claude Code version: [e.g., 1.0.0]
   - Shell: [e.g., zsh]
   
   **Additional context**
   Any other relevant information
   ```

3. **Tag Appropriately**
   - `bug` - Something isn't working
   - `documentation` - Documentation issues
   - `setup` - Installation problems

### Suggesting Improvements
