# Adaptive Complexity Design System for Claude Code Commands

## Executive Summary

This document defines the adaptive complexity system for Claude Code commands, enabling commands to scale their effort based on task complexity while preventing over-engineering for simple tasks.

## Core Principles

1. **Complexity-Aware**: Commands assess task complexity before execution
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add detail as needed
3. **User Control**: Users can override automatic complexity detection
4. **Efficiency First**: Use minimal resources for simple tasks
5. **Transparency**: Always explain why a particular approach was chosen

## Complexity Assessment Framework

### Automatic Detection Metrics

```yaml
complexity_indicators:
  simple:
    file_count: 1-2
    lines_of_code: < 100
    cyclomatic_complexity: < 10
    dependencies: 0-2
    cross_system_impact: false
    time_estimate: < 5 minutes
    
  medium:
    file_count: 3-10
    lines_of_code: 100-1000
    cyclomatic_complexity: 10-20
    dependencies: 3-10
    cross_system_impact: limited
    time_estimate: 5-30 minutes
    
  complex:
    file_count: > 10
    lines_of_code: > 1000
    cyclomatic_complexity: > 20
    dependencies: > 10
    cross_system_impact: true
    time_estimate: > 30 minutes
```

### Detection Implementation

```markdown
## Quick Complexity Check
I'll assess the task complexity:
- Files affected: [count]
- Code complexity: [low/medium/high]
- Dependencies: [count]
- Risk level: [low/medium/high]

Based on this assessment, I'll use a [simple/standard/comprehensive] approach.
```

## Adaptive Command Structure

### Command Template Pattern

```markdown
---
name: adaptive-command
description: Command that adapts to task complexity
usage: "/command <target> [--mode auto|simple|full]"
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Grep, Task]
---

# [Command Name]

## Complexity Assessment
[Quick assessment of task scope]

<simple-mode>
## Simple Approach (Detected: simple task)
- Direct execution
- Minimal analysis
- Basic validation
- No parallel agents
</simple-mode>

<medium-mode>
## Standard Approach (Detected: medium complexity)
- Structured analysis
- Pattern detection
- Moderate validation
- 1-2 parallel agents if beneficial
</medium-mode>

<complex-mode>
## Comprehensive Approach (Detected: complex task)
- Deep analysis
- Multiple validation phases
- Risk assessment
- 3-4 parallel agents for efficiency
</complex-mode>

## Progressive Execution
[Execute chosen approach with appropriate depth]
```

## Progressive Questioning Framework

### Question Escalation Pattern

```yaml
question_levels:
  level_0_automatic:
    # No questions - use intelligent defaults
    - detect_framework: "from package.json/requirements.txt"
    - detect_style: "from existing code patterns"
    - detect_conventions: "from file naming patterns"
    
  level_1_essential:
    # Only ask if truly ambiguous
    - primary_goal: "What outcome do you need?"
    - constraints: "Any specific requirements?"
    
  level_2_clarifying:
    # Ask when multiple valid approaches exist
    - approach_preference: "I see two options: A or B?"
    - integration_points: "Should this work with [existing component]?"
    
  level_3_detailed:
    # Ask for complex/risky operations
    - confirmation: "This will affect X files. Proceed?"
    - strategy: "Full refactor or incremental changes?"
```

### Implementation Example

```markdown
## Let me understand what you need

**Quick check**: I see this is a [detected type] project. 

<if-simple>
I'll proceed with standard [framework] patterns.
</if-simple>

<if-ambiguous>
**One question**: [Most important clarification]
- Option A: [Common approach with rationale]
- Option B: [Alternative with trade-offs]

Which fits better, or something else?
</if-ambiguous>

<if-complex>
**This looks complex**. Let me ask a few key questions:
1. [Scope question]
2. [Risk question]
3. [Preference question]

I'll make smart assumptions for the rest.
</if-complex>
```

## Command Consolidation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Adaptive Commands

#### `/start` - Adaptive Initialization
```yaml
modes:
  minimal: # < 1 minute
    - Create .claude/ directory
    - Add basic settings.json
    - Generate simple CLAUDE.md
    
  standard: # 2-3 minutes
    - Detect project type
    - Create tailored commands
    - Generate comprehensive CLAUDE.md
    
  comprehensive: # 5-10 minutes
    - Full project analysis
    - Custom command generation
    - Team conventions detection
    - Advanced configuration
```

#### `/analyze` - Adaptive Analysis
```yaml
modes:
  quick: # 30-second scan
    - File count and structure
    - Main technologies
    - Basic metrics
    
  standard: # 2-minute analysis
    - Pattern detection
    - Dependency mapping
    - Code quality metrics
    
  deep: # 5-minute investigation
    - Complexity analysis
    - Architecture assessment
    - Technical debt identification
    - Performance bottlenecks
```

#### `/build` - Adaptive Development
```yaml
modes:

    - Documentation
```

#### `/test` - Adaptive Testing
```yaml
modes:

    - Basic edge cases
    - 3-5 tests per function
    
  thorough: # Standard coverage
    - Happy and error paths
    - Edge case coverage
    - 10-15 tests per function
    
  comprehensive: # Full coverage

```

## Resource Optimization Strategy

### Tool Usage Scaling

```yaml
simple_tasks:
  tools: [Read, Write, Grep]
  agents: 0
  web_search: false
  execution_time: < 30 seconds
  
medium_tasks:
  tools: [Read, Write, Grep, Bash, Task]
  agents: 1-2 (only if beneficial)
  web_search: only if needed
  execution_time: 30 seconds - 2 minutes
  
complex_tasks:
  tools: [All available]
  agents: 3-5 (parallel execution)
  web_search: proactive research
  execution_time: 2-10 minutes
```

### Anti-Pattern Prevention

```yaml
prevent_over_engineering:
  - single_file_change: Never use parallel agents
  - simple_refactor: Skip web research
  - basic_tests: No complex framework detection
  - small_commits: Direct execution without analysis
  
prevent_under_engineering:
  - breaking_changes: Always ask confirmation
  - security_operations: Full validation required
  - complex_refactor: Use comprehensive analysis
  - production_deploy: Complete checklist needed
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Step 1: Create Test Framework
```bash
# Test different complexity levels
test_simple_task()    # 1 file, < 50 lines
test_medium_task()    # 5 files, 200 lines
test_complex_task()   # 20 files, 1000+ lines
```

### Step 2: Implement Core Commands
1. `/start` - Consolidate 5 initialization commands
2. `/analyze` - Merge 3 analysis commands
3. `/build` - Combine 3 development commands
4. `/test` - Unite 3 testing commands

### Step 3: Simplify Utility Commands
1. Reduce `/debug` from 102 to 50 lines
2. Simplify `/anti-pattern-audit` from 150 to 60 lines
3. Streamline `/commit` from 45 to 30 lines
4. Optimize other utilities

### Step 4: Validate Adaptive Behavior
1. Test complexity detection accuracy
2. Verify resource usage optimization
3. Validate user experience improvements
4. Measure performance gains

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Command count**: 22 â†’ 12 (45% reduction)
- **Average execution time**: 30% faster for simple tasks
- **Token usage**: 40% reduction for simple tasks
- **Parallel agents**: 70% reduction overall

### Qualitative Metrics
- **User satisfaction**: Fewer unnecessary questions
- **Clarity**: Clear command progression
- **Efficiency**: Right-sized responses
- **Maintainability**: Simpler codebase

## Conclusion

This adaptive complexity system ensures Claude Code commands provide appropriate responses for task complexity, preventing both over-engineering of simple tasks and under-engineering of complex ones. The system maintains high quality while optimizing for efficiency and user experience.
