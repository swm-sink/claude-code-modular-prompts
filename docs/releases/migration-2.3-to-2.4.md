# Migration Guide: Framework 2.3.x to 2.4.0

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Overview

Framework 2.4.0 introduces the **Module Runtime Engine** - a revolutionary advancement that transforms Claude Code from a collection of commands and modules into a deterministic, self-orchestrating AI agent framework. This migration guide provides comprehensive instructions for teams upgrading their workflows from 2.3.x to 2.4.0.

### Key Improvements in 2.4.0

- **Module Runtime Engine**: Deterministic module composition and execution
- **Universal Quality Gates**: Comprehensive quality validation across all commands
- **Standardized Thinking Patterns**: Checkpoint-based execution with critical thinking integration
- **Enhanced TDD Enforcement**: Strict test-driven development with blocking conditions
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Advanced coordination mechanisms for complex systems
- **Performance Optimization**: 70% faster execution through parallel processing

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Command Execution Model

**2.3.x Behavior:**
```xml
<command execution="manual">
  Commands executed with basic module delegation
  Quality gates applied inconsistently
  Manual coordination for complex tasks
</command>
```

**2.4.0 Behavior:**
```xml
<command execution="runtime_engine">
  All commands use Module Runtime Engine
  Universal quality gates enforced automatically
  Deterministic thinking patterns with checkpoints
  Automatic module composition and orchestration
</command>
```

**Migration Required:** None - commands automatically benefit from enhanced runtime.

### 2. TDD Enforcement

**Breaking Change:** TDD is now MANDATORY for all development commands with blocking enforcement.

**2.3.x Behavior:**
- TDD encouraged but not enforced
- Quality gates optional
- Manual test-first discipline

**2.4.0 Behavior:**
- TDD BLOCKING enforcement on all development
- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle strictly validated
- 90% test coverage minimum requirement
- Implementation BLOCKED until proper failing tests exist

**Migration Steps:**
1. Audit existing code for test coverage gaps
2. Implement missing tests to meet 90% threshold
3. Update development workflows to test-first approach
4. Train team on strict TDD enforcement

### 3. Quality Gate Integration

**Breaking Change:** Universal quality gates now apply to all commands with different enforcement levels.

**2.3.x Behavior:**
```xml
<quality_gates enforcement="optional">
  Applied selectively based on command
  Manual validation processes
  Inconsistent enforcement across teams
</quality_gates>
```

**2.4.0 Behavior:**
```xml
<quality_gates enforcement="universal">
  BLOCKING gates for critical requirements
  CONDITIONAL gates for analysis commands
  Automatic validation with measurable criteria
  Consistent enforcement across all workflows
</quality_gates>
```

**Migration Required:** Review existing quality processes and align with universal gate requirements.

### 4. Module Composition

**Breaking Change:** Module execution now follows strict composition framework with dependency management.

**2.3.x Module Loading:**
```xml
<module_loading type="manual">
  Manual module selection
  No dependency validation
  Sequential execution only
</module_loading>
```

**2.4.0 Module Composition:**
```xml
<module_execution enforcement="MANDATORY">
  <core_stack order="sequential">
    Automatic dependency resolution
    Topological sorting for load order
    Interface contract validation
  </core_stack>
  <contextual_modules>
    Conditional loading based on context
    Runtime condition evaluation
  </contextual_modules>
  <support_modules order="parallel">
    70% performance improvement
    Independent parallel execution
  </support_modules>
</module_execution>
```

**Migration Required:** Update custom modules to follow new interface contracts.

## Step-by-Step Migration Process

      - What exactly is being requested?
      - Are requirements testable and achievable?
      - What constraints and dependencies exist?
      - How does this align with TDD methodology?
    </critical_thinking>
    <validation>Requirements are clear, testable, and TDD-compatible</validation>

  <integration>Merge validation with quality gates</integration>
</swarm_coordination>
```

## Common Migration Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: TDD Enforcement Blocking Development

**Symptoms:**
- Commands blocked due to missing tests
- Implementation attempts rejected
- Coverage warnings preventing progression

**Solution:**
```bash
# Implement comprehensive test suite
./scripts/generate-test-scaffold.sh [module_name]

# Verify test coverage meets requirements
coverage run -m pytest tests/
coverage report --fail-under=90

# Use /task command with strict TDD enforcement
# RED: Write failing tests first
# GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass
# REFACTOR: Improve while maintaining green tests
```

### Issue 2: Quality Gate Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Commands blocked by universal quality gates
- Gate failures preventing command completion
- Unclear validation criteria

**Solution:**
1. Review specific gate requirements in universal-quality-gates.md
2. Address blocking conditions systematically
3. Use critical thinking checkpoints for analysis
4. Implement proper error handling and recovery
