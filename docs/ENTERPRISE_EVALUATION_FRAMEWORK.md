## Rigorous Assessment for Autonomous AI Development Systems

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-07-06  
**Framework Target**: Claude Code Modular Agents  
**Evaluation Standard**: Enterprise Production Readiness for AI Self-Checking Systems

---

## Executive Summary

This evaluation framework is specifically designed for **AI self-validation and autonomous development systems** - frameworks that enable AI agents to check their own work, validate their outputs, and operate with minimal human oversight. Based on 2025 enterprise AI governance standards, NIST AI Risk Management Framework, and the CLASSic evaluation methodology.

**Critical Warning**: Most enterprise AI frameworks score 40-60/100. Scores above 75 are exceptional, above 85 are world-class. This evaluation uses hypervigilant criteria to identify potential failure points in autonomous AI systems.
