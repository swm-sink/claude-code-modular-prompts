# Conductor Commands - Complete System Overview

## 🎯 System Architecture

Conductor Commands is a comprehensive Claude Code command system with two distinct layers:

### Layer 1: Initialization & Customization (30-60 min process)
**Purpose**: Deep discovery and customization to make commands specific to YOUR project

### Layer 2: Workflow Commands (Daily usage)
**Purpose**: Research-validated, TDD-enforced commands for development workflow

## 🚀 User Journey

### First Time Setup (30-60 minutes)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[/initialize] --> B[/consultation]
    B --> C[/analyze-project]
    C --> D[/generate-dna]
    D --> E[/tailor-commands]
    E --> F[Ready to Use!]
```

1. **`/initialize`** (2-3 min)
   - Detects your tech stack
   - Creates directory structure
   - Prepares consultation questions

2. **`/consultation`** (30-60 min)
   - Interactive Q&A session
   - Understands architecture, team, challenges
   - Saves responses for DNA generation

3. **`/analyze-project`** (10-15 min)
   - Deep automated code analysis
   - Extracts patterns and metrics
   - Identifies improvement opportunities

4. **`/generate-dna`** (2-3 min)
   - Combines consultation + analysis
   - Creates comprehensive PROJECT-DNA.md
   - Documents everything unique about your project

5. **`/tailor-commands`** (5 min)
   - Customizes ALL commands for your project
   - Replaces generic examples with your patterns
   - Creates new commands for your pain points

### Daily Usage (After Setup)

```bash
# Quick project setup
/orchestrate

# Or step-by-step workflow
/explore architecture    # Research-validated exploration
/plan "new feature"      # TDD-first planning
/implement --tdd         # RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
/validate               # Against standards
/commit                 # Atomic, documented
```

## 🔬 Core Principles

### 1. Research-First Development
- **Every decision** requires 3+ external sources
- **Current sources** (2024-2025) prioritized
- **Zero assumptions** - everything verified

### 2. Test-Driven Everything
```
RED → Write failing tests
GREEN → Minimum code to pass  
REFACTOR → Optimize with patterns
```

### 3. Project-Specific Customization
- Commands tailored to YOUR stack
- Examples use YOUR patterns
- Solves YOUR pain points

### 4. Zero Hallucination Tolerance
- No made-up metrics
- No unverified claims
- Evidence-based decisions only

## 🎯 Example: How Commands Get Tailored

### Before Tailoring (Generic)
```javascript
// /test-unit command
describe('Component', () => {
  it('should work', () => {
    // generic test
  });
});
```

### After Tailoring (Your Project)
```javascript
// /test-unit command (tailored for React + Jest + RTL)
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { mockApi } from '@/test-utils/mocks'; // YOUR utility
import { UserDashboard } from '@/components/UserDashboard'; // YOUR structure

describe('UserDashboard', () => {
  // YOUR pattern: always test loading states
  it('displays skeleton loader while fetching user data', () => {
    render(<UserDashboard userId="123" />);
    expect(screen.getByTestId('skeleton-loader')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  // YOUR requirement: 85% coverage minimum
  // YOUR convention: data-testid for critical elements
});
```

## 💡 Key Differentiators

### What Makes This Special

1. **Deep Consultation**: Not a survey, but adaptive conversation
2. **Evidence-Based**: Every pattern verified with research
3. **Project-Specific**: Commands literally rewritten for you
4. **Pain-Point Focused**: Creates commands for YOUR problems
5. **Living System**: Evolves as your project evolves

### What This Is NOT

- ❌ Generic templates you customize manually
- ❌ One-size-fits-all commands
- ❌ Static configuration files
- ❌ Assumptions about best practices

## 📈 Success Metrics

After using Conductor Commands:
- ✅ 100% of patterns research-validated
- ✅ 100% test coverage before implementation
- ✅ 0% hallucinated improvements
- ✅ Commands that understand YOUR project
- ✅ Automated solutions to YOUR pain points

## 🔄 Maintenance & Evolution

### Monthly Review
```bash
/update-dna          # Refresh PROJECT-DNA
/tailor-commands     # Re-customize with changes
```

### After Major Changes
- Architecture shifts
- Team restructuring  
- New pain points
- Technology migrations

# Step 2: Deep Consultation (30-60 min)
/consultation
# Answer questions thoroughly
# Be honest about pain points
# Share real challenges
