## Reasoning Patterns

### 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Pattern

<pattern_specification>
  <pattern_id>cot-001</pattern_id>
  <effectiveness_score>0.85</effectiveness_score>
  <best_for>Mathematical problems, logical analysis, step-by-step reasoning</best_for>
  <token_efficiency>Medium (adds 20-30% tokens for 40-60% accuracy improvement)</token_efficiency>
</pattern_specification>

**Purpose**: Enables explicit step-by-step reasoning by requesting intermediate logical steps.

**Template Structure**:
```xml
<reasoning_prompt>
  <task>[Problem description]</task>
  
  <instructions>
    Let's work through this step-by-step:
    
    Step 1: [Analyze the problem]
    - What are we trying to solve?
    - What information do we have?
    
    Step 2: [Identify the approach]
    - What method should we use?
    - Why is this the best approach?
    
    Step 3: [Execute the solution]
    - Apply the chosen method
    - Show all calculations/reasoning
    
    Step 4: [Verify the result]
    - Does the answer make sense?
    - Can we verify it another way?
  </instructions>
</reasoning_prompt>
```

**Practical Examples**:

<example_1>
  <context>API Design Problem</context>
  <prompt>
    Design a REST API for a blog system. Let's work through this step-by-step:

    Step 1: Identify core resources
    - What are the main entities? (posts, users, comments, categories)
    - What relationships exist between them?

    Step 2: Define CRUD operations
    - What operations does each resource need?
    - How do users interact with each resource?

    Step 3: Design URL structure
    - What's the logical hierarchy?
    - How do we handle nested resources?

    Step 4: Consider constraints and security
    - What authentication is needed?
    - What rate limits and validation rules apply?

    Please show your reasoning for each step.
  </prompt>
</example_1>

<example_2>
  <context>Code Refactoring Problem</context>
  <prompt>
    Refactor this legacy function to improve performance and readability. Let's analyze step-by-step:

    Step 1: Understand current functionality
    - What does this function do?
    - What are its inputs and outputs?

    Step 2: Identify performance bottlenecks
    - Where are the inefficiencies?
    - What's causing the slowdown?

    Step 3: Plan the refactoring approach
    - What patterns should we apply?
    - How can we maintain backward compatibility?

    Step 4: Implement and validate
    - Write the improved version
    - Verify it produces the same results

    [Insert legacy code here]

    Please show your analysis for each step.
  </prompt>
</example_2>

**Best Practices**:
- Use explicit step indicators (numbers, bullets, or sequence words)
- Request justification for each reasoning step
- Include a verification or validation step
- Limit to 5-7 steps for optimal clarity
- Works best with problems that have logical progression

**Anti-Patterns**:
- Don't use for simple tasks that don't require multi-step reasoning
- Avoid when speed is prioritized over accuracy
- Don't chain too many steps (causes confusion)
- Avoid for purely creative tasks where logic isn't the primary requirement

### 2. Tree-of-Thought (ToT) Pattern

<pattern_specification>
  <pattern_id>tot-001</pattern_id>
  <effectiveness_score>0.78</effectiveness_score>
  <best_for>Creative problem-solving, scenarios with multiple valid approaches</best_for>
  <token_efficiency>Low (significantly increases tokens but improves solution quality)</token_efficiency>
</pattern_specification>

**Purpose**: Enables parallel exploration of multiple reasoning paths with backtracking capability.

**Template Structure**:
```xml
<exploration_prompt>
  <problem>[Problem statement]</problem>
  
  <instructions>
    Let's explore multiple approaches to solve this:

    <approach name="A">
      <strategy>[First approach description]</strategy>
      <reasoning>[Why this approach makes sense]</reasoning>
      <pros>[Advantages of this path]</pros>
      <cons>[Limitations and risks]</cons>
      <execution>[How to implement this approach]</execution>
    </approach>

    <approach name="B">

      <pros>[Advantages of this path]</pros>
      <cons>[Limitations and risks]</cons>
      <execution>[How to implement this approach]</execution>
    </approach>

    <synthesis>
      <comparison>Compare all approaches against criteria: [list criteria]</comparison>

      <rationale>Explain why this choice is optimal</rationale>
    </synthesis>
  </instructions>
</exploration_prompt>
```

  <combination name="analytical_reasoning">
    <patterns>XML-Structured + Chain-of-Thought + Self-Consistency</patterns>
    <use_case>Complex technical analysis requiring structured thinking</use_case>
    <effectiveness>0.87</effectiveness>
    <example>System architecture decisions with multiple criteria</example>
  </combination>

  <combination name="rapid_prototyping">
    <patterns>Few-Shot + Token-Efficient + Role-Based</patterns>
    <use_case>Quick generation of domain-specific content</use_case>
    <effectiveness>0.79</effectiveness>
    <example>API documentation generation by technical writer persona</example>
  </combination>

  <combination name="comprehensive_evaluation">
    <patterns>Tree-of-Thought + Parallel-Processing + XML-Structured</patterns>
    <use_case>Evaluating multiple options with detailed analysis</use_case>
    <effectiveness>0.85</effectiveness>
    <example>Technology selection with multiple evaluation criteria</example>
  </combination>
