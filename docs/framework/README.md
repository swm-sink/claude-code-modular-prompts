# Important Notes


# What This Framework IS
✅ A personal productivity tool for Claude Code users  
✅ A sophisticated prompt engineering system  
✅ A modular command system with GitHub integration  
✅ A collection of best practices and quality reminders  


# What This Framework IS NOT
❌ NOT autonomous AI agents  
❌ NOT enterprise software  
❌ NOT a development platform  
❌ NOT a replacement for good development practices  


# Archived Documentation

Enterprise-focused documentation that doesn't reflect the framework's actual purpose has been moved to [`archive/enterprise-docs/`](../archive/enterprise-docs/). These documents describe features that don't exist in this personal development tool.


# Getting Help

1. **Use the `/docs` command**: Search and navigate documentation
2. **Check the guides**: Most common issues are documented
3. **Read the source**: Commands and modules have inline documentation
4. **Be realistic**: This is a prompt enhancement tool, not magic

---

**Remember**: This framework enhances Claude Code through better organization and smart defaults. Always maintain realistic expectations about its capabilities as a personal development tool.
