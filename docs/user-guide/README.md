## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands
```bash
/auto "your request"          # Intelligent routing - use when unsure
/task "focused work"          # Single component with TDD
/feature "complete feature"   # Full feature lifecycle with PRD
/query "research question"    # Analysis without modifications
```

### Support Commands
```bash
/session "long-running work"  # Extended work sessions
/swarm "complex coordination" # Multi-agent coordination
/protocol "production work"   # Production-ready workflows
/docs "documentation"         # Documentation generation
```

### Meta Commands
```bash
/meta-review "analyze performance"    # Framework analysis
/meta-optimize "improve efficiency"   # Performance optimization
/meta-evolve "adapt to patterns"     # Adaptive learning
/meta-govern "enforce compliance"     # Governance and compliance
```

## Common Workflows

### New Feature Development
```bash
1. /query "understand existing related functionality"
2. /feature "implement new feature with requirements"
3. /task "add specific component or fix"
4. /protocol "prepare for production deployment"
```

### Bug Investigation and Fix
```bash
1. /query "analyze the bug and understand root cause"
2. /task "implement fix with comprehensive tests"
3. /protocol "ensure fix meets production standards"
```

### Code Research and Documentation
```bash
1. /query "analyze codebase and create documentation"
2. /docs "generate comprehensive documentation"
3. /task "add missing tests or improve coverage"
```

## Configuration Quick Start

### Basic PROJECT_CONFIG.xml
```xml
<project_config>
  <tech_stack>
    <primary_language>python</primary_language>
    <framework>django</framework>
  </tech_stack>
  <commands>
    <test>pytest --cov=src</test>
    <lint>flake8 src</lint>
  </commands>
  <quality_standards>
    <test_coverage>
      <threshold>90</threshold>
    </test_coverage>
  </quality_standards>
</project_config>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Commands not working
- **Solution**: Check CLAUDE.md is in project root
- **Check**: Verify .claude directory exists

**Issue**: Generic responses
- **Solution**: Customize PROJECT_CONFIG.xml for your tech stack
- **Check**: Verify configuration is project-specific

**Issue**: Quality gates not enforcing
- **Solution**: Check quality_standards in PROJECT_CONFIG.xml
- **Check**: Verify enforcement is set to "blocking"

### Getting Help

1. **[Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions
2. **[FAQ](faq.md)** - Frequently asked questions
3. **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/swm-sink/claude-code-modular-prompts/issues)** - Report bugs
