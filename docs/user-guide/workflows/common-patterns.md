# Common Workflow Patterns

> **Goal**: Learn the most effective workflow patterns that will make you productive immediately.

These are the patterns that experienced framework users rely on daily.

## üîÑ The Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Execute Pattern

### Basic Pattern
```bash
# 1. Research: Understand current state
/query "analyze the current user authentication system"

# 2. Plan: Determine approach
/auto "improve user authentication with modern practices"
# Framework analyzes and suggests approach

# 3. Execute: Implement with appropriate command
/feature "modernized authentication with OAuth and 2FA"
```

**When to use**: Any significant change or improvement.

### Advanced Pattern with Validation
```bash
# 1. Research: Deep understanding
/query "analyze authentication security vulnerabilities"

/docs generate "Security Best Practices Guide"
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
# 1. Performance profiling

# 3. Targeted improvements
/task "optimize slow database queries"
/task "implement component memoization"
/task "add lazy loading for large components"

# 4. Measurement

## üí° Pro Tips for Workflow Efficiency

### 1. Always Start with Understanding
```bash
# Before any changes, understand the current state
/query "analyze current implementation"
# Then make informed decisions
```

### 2. Use `/auto` for Complex Decisions
```bash
# When approach isn't clear
/auto "improve our testing strategy"
# Framework will analyze and route optimally
```

### 3. Combine Commands for Complex Workflows
```bash
# Research phase
/query "understand current state"
# Planning phase  
/auto "determine best approach"
# Execution phase
/task "implement specific changes"
# Documentation phase
/docs "update relevant documentation"
```

### 4. Leverage Session Management
```bash
# For multi-day work
/session "implement complex feature X"
# Framework tracks progress across sessions
```

### 5. Use Appropriate Quality Gates
```bash
# For production-critical work
/protocol "deploy critical security fix"
# For regular development
/task "add new utility function"
```
