## 🎭 Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Areas
1. **Claude Code Compatibility** - Test early and often
2. **Security Vulnerabilities** - External audit before launch
3. **Performance at Scale** - Load test with real workloads
4. **User Adoption** - Focus on onboarding experience

### Mitigation Strategies
- Daily testing in real Claude Code environment
- Security review at each phase gate
- Performance benchmarking weekly
- User feedback sessions bi-weekly

---

## 📞 Communication Plan

### Internal Updates
- Daily standups during Weeks 1-4
- Weekly progress reports
- Phase gate reviews

### External Communication
- Week 4: Alpha announcement
- Week 6: Beta program launch
- Week 8: Public preview
- Week 10: General availability

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

**Focus relentlessly on the MVP path:**
1. Get 10 commands working perfectly
2. Create minimal but excellent documentation
3. Test with 5 real teams
4. Fix what breaks
5. Then expand

**Do NOT:**
- Try to launch all 79 commands
- Build perfect infrastructure first
- Wait for 100% test coverage
- Over-engineer the solution

**Success looks like:**
- 5 happy beta teams using daily
- <5 minute onboarding
- Zero critical bugs in production
- Clear path to expand beyond MVP
