## Report Navigation Guide

### For Project Overview
1. Start with `deployment/PROJECT-STATUS.md` for current status
2. Review `architecture/ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md` for system understanding
3. Check latest `analysis/FINAL-*` reports for completion status

### For Technical Analysis
1. Explore `analysis/COMPREHENSIVE-*` files for detailed evaluations
2. Review `quality/PERFORMANCE-INTEGRATION-REPORT.md` for performance data
3. Check `testing/` directory for validation results

### For Historical Context
1. `analysis/STEP-*` files show incremental development progression
2. `analysis/ULTRATHINK-*` files provide strategic decision context
3. Sequential numbered reports show project evolution

## Report Quality Levels

### High-Quality Reports
- Architecture documentation with clear structure
- Deployment assessments with concrete criteria
- Data files with measurable results

### Historical Reports  
- Step-by-step analysis files (valuable for understanding evolution)
- Strategic planning documents (context for decisions)
- Comprehensive reviews (learning from past approaches)

## Usage Guidelines

### For Users
- Focus on `deployment/` and `architecture/` for practical information
- Use `data/` JSON files for objective metrics

### For Developers
- Review `testing/` reports for validation frameworks
- Check `quality/` reports for performance benchmarks  
- Analyze `analysis/` reports for lessons learned

### For Project Management
- Monitor `deployment/PROJECT-STATUS.md` for readiness
- Track progress through sequential `analysis/STEP-*` files
- Review `security/` reports for compliance status

*Reports are generated by scripts in the `scripts/` directory and reflect various stages of project development.*
