## 👤 USER JOURNEY ANALYSIS (Steps 16-20)

### Step 16-17: New User Onboarding Flow

#### The 30-Second Success Path:
```
1. Discovery (0-10 seconds):
   - User finds GitHub repository
   - README immediately communicates value: "7 universal commands that work immediately"
   - Clear installation promise: "30 seconds, no configuration"

2. Installation (10-30 seconds):
   - Single command: ./setup-minimal.sh /path/to/project
   - Automatic detection and setup
   - Clear success confirmation

3. First Success (30-60 seconds):
   - Open Claude Code in project
   - Try /help to see commands
   - Execute /task "add user authentication"
   - Immediate, contextual assistance

4. Value Realization (1-5 minutes):
   - Commands automatically adapt to tech stack
   - No configuration or customization needed
   - Real development tasks completed immediately
```

#### Onboarding Success Factors:
- ✅ **Immediate Value**: Commands work without setup
- ✅ **Universal Compatibility**: Any language/framework supported
- ✅ **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple start, advanced features available
- ✅ **Clear Documentation**: FAQ and troubleshooting readily available

### Step 18: Advanced User Workflow Analysis

#### Power User Journey:
```
1. Template Library Discovery (After basic success):
   - User wants more specialized commands
   - Discovers ./setup.sh for full 82-command library
   - Understands customization requirements

2. Component-Based Development:
   - Discovers 91-component library
   - Uses atomic components for custom commands
   - Creates project-specific workflows

3. Team Integration:
   - Shares customized commands via git
   - Establishes team coding standards
   - Integrates with CI/CD workflows

4. Advanced Orchestration:
   - Uses /swarm for complex multi-agent workflows
   - Implements DAG-based task orchestration
   - Creates specialized automation patterns
```

#### Advanced Success Factors:
- ✅ **Scalability**: Grows from simple to enterprise complexity
- ✅ **Customization**: Template library for specialized needs
- ✅ **Team Collaboration**: Git-based sharing and standardization
- ✅ **Innovation**: Cutting-edge AI orchestration patterns

### Step 19: Edge Case & Error Scenarios

#### Common Edge Cases Handled:
```
1. Existing .claude Directory:
   - Automatic backup to .claude.backup
   - Non-destructive installation
   - Clear rollback instructions

2. Unsupported Project Types:
   - Commands still work with generic patterns
   - Universal compatibility maintained
   - Clear guidance for unsupported scenarios

3. Permission Issues:
   - Clear error messages with solutions
   - chmod +x instructions provided
   - Security best practices explained

4. Claude Code Integration Issues:
   - Commands not appearing → restart instructions
   - Tool permissions → settings.json guidance
   - Context loading → memory management tips
```

#### Error Recovery Quality:
- ✅ **Non-Destructive**: Backup existing configurations
- ✅ **Clear Messaging**: Actionable error messages
- ✅ **Self-Healing**: Automatic detection and correction
- ✅ **Comprehensive FAQ**: Common issues pre-answered
