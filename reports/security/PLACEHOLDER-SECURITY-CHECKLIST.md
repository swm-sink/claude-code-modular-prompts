# Placeholder Security Checklist

**Critical Security Protocol for Safe Placeholder Replacement**

## Pre-Replacement Security Setup

### üîí Environment Preparation

**Data Protection**
```markdown
‚ñ° Create complete backup of .claude/ directory
‚ñ° Initialize or commit current state to version control
‚ñ° Work in isolated environment (not production)
‚ñ° Document all planned replacement values
‚ñ° Prepare rollback plan in case of issues
```

**Security Tools Setup**
```markdown
‚ñ° Install validation script (if available)
‚ñ° Set up secure text editor with find/replace
‚ñ° Configure file monitoring for change tracking  
‚ñ° Prepare security scanning tools
‚ñ° Enable file system snapshots/backups
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Value Preparation Security

**Input Value Validation**
```markdown
‚ñ° Validate each replacement value against input guidelines
‚ñ° Check maximum length limits (100 characters per value)  
‚ñ° Verify character whitelist compliance (alphanumeric + -_. only)
‚ñ° Scan for dangerous patterns (commands, scripts, HTML)
‚ñ° Test values with validation script if available
‚ñ° Document validation results for each placeholder
```

**Security Pattern Checking**
```markdown
‚ñ° No quotes: ', ", `
‚ñ° No command separators: ;, &, |, &&, ||
‚ñ° No path traversal: ../, ..\, \\
‚ñ° No HTML/script tags: <script>, <iframe>, etc.
‚ñ° No system commands: cmd, bash, sh, eval, exec  
‚ñ° No variable expansion: ${}, $(), %%, ``
‚ñ° No special characters: @, #, $, %, ^, *, +, =
‚ñ° No brackets or parens: (), [], {}
```

## During Replacement Security Protocol

### üîç File-by-File Security Process

**Before Opening Each File**
```markdown
‚ñ° Verify file is in expected location (.claude/commands/)
‚ñ° Check file hasn't been tampered with externally
‚ñ° Confirm file size is reasonable (not corrupted)
‚ñ° Review file last modified timestamp
```

**During Find/Replace Operations**
```markdown
‚ñ° Use "Match Case" option to ensure exact matching
‚ñ° Review each match before confirming replacement
‚ñ° Replace one placeholder type at a time systematically
‚ñ° Avoid "Replace All" without reviewing matches first
‚ñ° Save file after each placeholder type completion
‚ñ° Test file syntax/structure after major changes
```

**After Each File Modification**
```markdown
‚ñ° Verify file still has proper markdown structure
‚ñ° Check YAML front matter is intact
‚ñ° Confirm no unintended text was replaced
‚ñ° Search for any remaining [INSERT_ patterns in file
‚ñ° Save and close file before moving to next
```

### üö® Security Violation Response

**If Dangerous Pattern Detected**
```markdown
‚ñ° STOP replacement process immediately
‚ñ° Document the dangerous pattern found
‚ñ° Revert to backup version of affected file
‚ñ° Re-validate the problematic replacement value
‚ñ° Update replacement value to safe alternative
‚ñ° Re-run validation before attempting replacement again
```

**If Unexpected File Changes Detected**
```markdown
‚ñ° Compare current file to backup version
‚ñ° Identify all unintended changes
‚ñ° Revert file to last known good state
‚ñ° Review replacement process for errors
‚ñ° Fix process and restart replacement for that file
```

## Post-Replacement Security Verification

### üî¨ Comprehensive Security Audit

**Pattern Verification**
```markdown
‚ñ° Search entire .claude/ directory for "[INSERT_" patterns
‚ñ° Verify no placeholders remain unreplaced
‚ñ° Check for malformed replacement patterns
‚ñ° Scan for any doubled or nested replacements
‚ñ° Confirm all replacements use expected values
```

**Content Security Scan**
```markdown
‚ñ° Scan all modified files for dangerous patterns
‚ñ° Check for script injection signatures
‚ñ° Verify no command execution patterns introduced
‚ñ° Confirm no path traversal patterns exist
‚ñ° Validate no HTML/XML injection occurred
‚ñ° Check for quote escaping issues
```

**Structural Integrity Check**
```markdown
‚ñ° Verify all markdown files have valid syntax
‚ñ° Check YAML front matter is properly formatted
‚ñ° Confirm code blocks and formatting intact
‚ñ° Validate internal links still work
‚ñ° Test command structure compliance
```

### üß™ Functional Security Testing

**Command Execution Safety**
```markdown
‚ñ° Test 3-5 sample commands in safe environment
‚ñ° Verify commands execute without errors
‚ñ° Check command outputs for unexpected content
‚ñ° Confirm no system information leakage
‚ñ° Validate commands behave as expected
‚ñ° Test both simple and complex commands
```

**Context Loading Security**
```markdown
‚ñ° Verify Claude Code loads commands correctly
‚ñ° Check for any error messages during loading
‚ñ° Confirm context files load without issues
‚ñ° Test command discovery works properly
‚ñ° Validate help system still functions
```

## Security Incident Response

### üö® If Security Issue Discovered

**Immediate Response**
```markdown
‚ñ° STOP using the affected commands immediately
‚ñ° Document the security issue in detail
‚ñ° Revert to backup version immediately
‚ñ° Identify root cause of security issue
‚ñ° Update security procedures to prevent recurrence
```

**Investigation Protocol**
```markdown
‚ñ° Review all replacement values for similar issues
‚ñ° Check validation process for gaps
‚ñ° Scan all files for similar security problems
‚ñ° Document lessons learned
‚ñ° Update security checklist with new requirements
```

**Remediation Steps**
```markdown
‚ñ° Fix all identified security issues
‚ñ° Re-validate all replacement values
‚ñ° Re-test entire replacement process
‚ñ° Update documentation with security fixes
‚ñ° Commit secure version to version control
```

## Long-term Security Maintenance

### üîÑ Ongoing Security Practices

**Regular Security Audits**
```markdown
‚ñ° Monthly scan for dangerous patterns
‚ñ° Quarterly validation of all replacement values
‚ñ° Annual review of security procedures
‚ñ° Update validation rules based on new threats
‚ñ° Monitor for changes to template library
```

**Security Updates**
```markdown
‚ñ° Subscribe to security updates for template library
‚ñ° Review security advisories for Claude Code
‚ñ° Update validation scripts when new threats identified
‚ñ° Participate in security discussions with community
‚ñ° Report security issues to template maintainers
```

## Emergency Procedures

### üö® Security Breach Response

**If Malicious Content Detected**
```
1. IMMEDIATELY stop all command usage
2. Disconnect from network if commands have network access
3. Revert ALL files to last known secure backup
4. Report incident to security team/maintainers
5. Do not attempt to "fix" compromised commands
6. Start replacement process from scratch with enhanced validation
```

**Recovery Checklist**
```markdown
‚ñ° Restore from secure backup
‚ñ° Re-validate entire security process
‚ñ° Test all commands before resuming use
‚ñ° Document incident for future prevention
‚ñ° Update security procedures based on lessons learned
```

## Validation Tools

### üõ†Ô∏è Security Validation Commands

**Pre-replacement Validation**
```bash
# Validate replacement values (if script available)
./scripts/validate_placeholder_inputs.py values.txt

# Check for dangerous patterns in input
grep -E '[\'"`;|&<>]' replacement-values.txt
```

**Post-replacement Security Scan**
```bash
# Check for remaining placeholders
find .claude/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "\[INSERT_" {} \;

# Scan for dangerous patterns
find .claude/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l -E '[\'"`;|&]' {} \;

# Validate file integrity
find .claude/ -name "*.md" -exec head -3 {} \; | grep -E "^name:|^description:"
```

**Emergency Security Scan**
```bash
# Comprehensive security audit
grep -r -E "(cmd|bash|sh|eval|exec)" .claude/
grep -r -E "<script|javascript:|onclick" .claude/
grep -r -E "\.\./|\\\\|%2e%2e" .claude/
```
