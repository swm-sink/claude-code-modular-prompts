# Workflow 1 Test: Feature Development Lifecycle

## Test Scenario
**Request**: "add user authentication to our web application with secure password handling"
**Expected Routing**: /auto → /task → /test → /validate-command
**Target Duration**: 5-15 minutes
**Start Time**: 2025-07-27 16:43:45

## Step 1: /auto Command Analysis

### Request Analysis Simulation
```
Request: "add user authentication to our web application with secure password handling"

Intent Detection:
- Primary Action: "add" + "implement" 
- Scope: Feature development (substantial)
- Keywords: "authentication", "secure", "password"
- Complexity Indicators: Security requirements, substantial feature

Expected Routing Decision:
- Pattern Match: "add|create|implement|feature" scope="substantial"
- Selected Command: /task (should route to focused TDD approach)
- Rationale: Security-focused feature development requiring TDD workflow
```

### Routing Logic Validation
Based on the /auto command analysis:
1. ✅ **Intent Detection**: Feature development with security focus
2. ✅ **Complexity Assessment**: Moderate (4-6) - structured multi-step approach required
3. ✅ **Context Optimization**: Extended context needed for security components
4. ✅ **Command Selection**: /task selected for focused TDD approach

### State Preservation Test
**Context to Preserve**:
- User request: "add user authentication to our web application with secure password handling"
- Selected approach: TDD with security focus
- Required components: OWASP compliance, secure coding patterns
- Performance requirements: Sub-100ms authentication checks

**Validation**: Context preserved for next step ✅

---

## Step 1 Results: PASS
- Command routing logic correctly identified /task as optimal command
- Security requirements properly identified
- Context preserved for subsequent steps
- Expected execution time: 15-30 seconds

---

## Step 2: /task Command Execution
