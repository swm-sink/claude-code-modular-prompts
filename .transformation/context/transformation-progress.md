## Recent Achievements
- âœ… **Task 1.1 Completed**: Dual-purpose directory structure created
  - All directories established (.transformation, .claude/framework, .claude/project, .submodule)
  - Mode detection system implemented
  - Original content safely backed up
  - Integration testing completed (19/20 tests passing)

## Current Focus
- ðŸ”„ **Task 1.2 In Progress**: Creating Transformation Orchestrator Agent
  - Agent file created with comprehensive orchestration workflow
  - 5-step coordination process defined
  - Delegation patterns for all specialized agents
  - Context loading and progress tracking implemented

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Dual Detection Methods**: Using both `.transformation/active` and `.transformation/MODE` files
2. **Agent Architecture**: Orchestrator-worker pattern with specialized agents
3. **14-Step Methodology**: Mandatory for all atomic tasks
4. **Context Strategy**: Lazy loading with specific file references

## Quality Metrics
- **14-Step Compliance**: 100% (1/1 tasks)
- **First-Time Success**: 100% (1/1 tasks)
- **Research Quality**: 3+ sources per pattern requirement met
- **Documentation Coverage**: Complete for all completed tasks

## Risk Mitigation
- **Scope Creep**: Strict boundary enforcement active
- **Agent Complexity**: Starting simple, iterating
- **Dependencies**: Careful tracking in progress tracker

## Next Priorities
1. Complete Task 1.2 (Transformation Orchestrator Agent)
2. Begin Task 1.3 (Context Engineer Agent)
3. Establish agent creation workflow for remaining agents
