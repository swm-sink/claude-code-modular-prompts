## Quick Start (30 seconds)

### 1. Copy Framework to Your Project
```bash
# Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/swm-sink/claude-code-modular-prompts.git

# Copy to your project (replace 'your-project' with your actual project path)
cp -r claude-code-modular-prompts/.claude your-project/
cp claude-code-modular-prompts/CLAUDE.md your-project/
cp claude-code-modular-prompts/PROJECT_CONFIG.xml your-project/

# Navigate to your project
cd your-project/
```

### 2. Test Basic Functionality
```bash
# Test the framework responds
/auto "analyze my project structure"
```

**‚úÖ Success Indicator**: Claude Code responds with project-specific analysis and suggestions

---

## Step-by-Step Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Prerequisites Check
Ensure you have:
- [ ] **Claude Code** (Claude Desktop App) installed
- [ ] **Git** for version control
- [ ] **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) for issue tracking: `gh auth login`
- [ ] **Python 3.8+** for monitoring: `python --version`
- [ ] **Basic terminal access**

### Step 2: Framework Installation
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/swm-sink/claude-code-modular-prompts.git
cd claude-code-modular-prompts

# 2. Verify framework structure
ls -la .claude/
# Should show: commands/, modules/, system/, domain/, templates/, etc.

# 3. Copy framework to your project
cp -r .claude /path/to/your-project/
cp CLAUDE.md /path/to/your-project/
cp PROJECT_CONFIG.xml /path/to/your-project/
```

### Step 3: Project Configuration
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your-project/

# Edit PROJECT_CONFIG.xml for your project
# See PROJECT_CONFIG.xml comments for all options
```

**Key Configuration Areas:**
- **Tech Stack**: Set your primary language (Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.)
- **Project Structure**: Define your src/, tests/, docs/ directories
- **Quality Standards**: Set test coverage thresholds, lint rules
- **Development Commands**: Customize test, build, lint commands

### Step 4: Framework Validation
```bash
# Test each essential command
/auto "understand my project"         # Should analyze your codebase
/task "create a simple function"      # Should create tests first
/feature "add user authentication"    # Should create PRD and plan
/query "how is my code structured?"   # Should analyze without changing
```

**‚úÖ Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] `/auto` provides project-specific suggestions
- [ ] `/task` mentions creating tests first (TDD)
- [ ] `/feature` asks about requirements or creates PRD
- [ ] `/query` analyzes without modifying code
- [ ] All commands reference your actual tech stack

---

## Essential Commands Overview

### ü§ñ `/auto` - Intelligent Routing
**When to use**: When you're unsure which command to use or want framework to decide
```bash
/auto "add user authentication"     # ‚Üí Routes to /feature (complex feature)
/auto "fix login bug"              # ‚Üí Routes to /task (focused fix)
/auto "understand auth system"     # ‚Üí Routes to /query (research)
```

### üîß `/task` - Focused Development
**When to use**: Single component work, bug fixes, small features
```bash
/task "add password validation"    # ‚Üí Creates tests first, then implementation
/task "fix email validation bug"   # ‚Üí Identifies issue, creates test, fixes
```

### üèóÔ∏è `/feature` - Complete Feature Development
**When to use**: New features, major functionality, multi-component work
```bash
/feature "shopping cart system"    # ‚Üí PRD ‚Üí planning ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí validation
/feature "user profile with avatar upload"  # ‚Üí Complete feature lifecycle
```

### üîç `/query` - Research & Analysis
**When to use**: Understanding code, research, analysis without changes
```bash
/query "how does our auth work?"   # ‚Üí Analysis without modifications
/query "what are the security patterns?"  # ‚Üí Research existing patterns
```

## Success Validation

### ‚úÖ Tier 1 Complete (30 seconds - 5 minutes)
- [ ] Framework responds to `/auto` command
- [ ] Suggestions mention your actual tech stack (React, Django, Go, etc.)
- [ ] Quality enforcement works (mentions tests, security, performance)
- [ ] Commands understand your project structure

### ‚úÖ Tier 2 Complete (5-30 minutes)
- [ ] `/task` creates tests before implementation (TDD)
- [ ] `/feature` produces PRD and implementation plan
- [ ] `/query` analyzes without changing code
- [ ] Commands suggest patterns specific to your project
- [ ] Quality gates enforce coverage thresholds

### ‚úÖ Tier 3 Complete (30+ minutes)
- [ ] Framework learns your coding style and patterns
- [ ] Commands adapt to your project's specific requirements
- [ ] Meta-commands optimize workflow for your team
- [ ] Custom configuration improves suggestions over time

## Common Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Command not recognized"
**Solution**: Ensure CLAUDE.md is in your project root and Claude Code can access it
```bash
# Check file exists
ls -la CLAUDE.md

# Check .claude directory
ls -la .claude/
```

### Issue: "Generic suggestions, not project-specific"
**Solution**: Customize PROJECT_CONFIG.xml for your tech stack
```xml
<!-- Edit PROJECT_CONFIG.xml -->
<project_config>
  <tech_stack>
    <primary_language>python</primary_language>
    <framework>django</framework>
    <database>postgresql</database>
  </tech_stack>
</project_config>
```

### Issue: "Commands don't enforce quality"
**Solution**: Verify quality gates are enabled in PROJECT_CONFIG.xml
```xml
<quality_standards>
  <test_coverage>
    <threshold>90</threshold>
    <enforcement>blocking</enforcement>
  </test_coverage>
</quality_standards>
```

### Issue: "Framework seems slow"
**Solution**: 
1. Check .claude directory has reasonable file count (should be ~166 files)
2. Reduce context by focusing commands on specific areas
3. Use `/query` for research, `/task` for implementation

## What's Next?

### üéØ **Master the Basics** (recommended next step)
Try all 4 essential commands in your project:
1. `/auto "analyze my project"`
2. `/task "create a simple utility function"`
3. `/feature "add basic search functionality"`
4. `/query "what are my project's main components?"`

### üîß **Customize for Your Project**
- Edit PROJECT_CONFIG.xml for your exact tech stack
- Adjust quality thresholds and enforcement rules
- Add custom development commands for your workflow

### üöÄ **Advanced Usage**
- Explore `/session` for long-running work
- Use `/swarm` for complex multi-component features
- Try `/protocol` for production-ready workflows
- Investigate meta-commands for framework optimization
