## 2. Critical Path Identification and Sequencing

### 2.1 Phase 2 Critical Path Analysis

**Sequential dependencies create 5-7 week critical path through Phase 2**:

#### Critical Path Sequence (Cannot be parallelized)

##### Week 1-2: Reference System Repair (CRITICAL BOTTLENECK #1)
**Why Critical**: 67.1% of files have broken references blocking all optimization work
- **Core system validation**: build-command.md, test.md, assemble-command.md must function
- **Circular dependency resolution**: 8 architectural loops prevent clean refactoring
- **Reference architecture**: Framework needed to prevent regression during optimization
- **Blocking Impact**: All subsequent optimization requires functioning reference system

##### Week 3-4: Core Command Validation (CRITICAL BOTTLENECK #2)  
**Why Critical**: Template generation system must work before schema changes
- **Template generation testing**: Users must be able to create templates throughout process
- **Command chaining validation**: Progressive disclosure system must remain functional
- **Integration testing**: End-to-end workflows must pass before XML modifications
- **Blocking Impact**: Schema changes without validated commands risk system-wide failure

##### Week 5-7: Schema Consolidation (CRITICAL BOTTLENECK #3)
**Why Critical**: 210 â†’ 30 tag reduction requires careful sequencing to prevent breakage
- **Schema definition**: Must complete before migration tooling development
- **Migration tooling**: Cannot start until target schema finalized
