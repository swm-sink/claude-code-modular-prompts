# Development Scripts Directory

This directory contains development-focused scripts for framework maintainers, contributors, and advanced users working on framework internals.

```

## Categories

### Testing Scripts (`testing/`)
**Purpose**: Framework testing, validation, and quality assurance during development

- `test-framework-enhancement.sh` - Framework enhancement testing
- `test-quality-gates.sh` - Quality gate validation testing
- `test-runner.py` - Comprehensive test runner for framework components

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run framework enhancement tests
bash internal/development/testing/test-framework-enhancement.sh

# Validate quality gates
bash internal/development/testing/test-quality-gates.sh

# Run comprehensive tests
python internal/development/testing/test-runner.py
```

### Optimization Scripts (`optimization/`)
**Purpose**: Performance optimization, quality improvement, and framework enhancement

- `optimize.py` - Framework performance optimization analyzer
- `performance_optimizer.py` - Performance optimization tools
- `quality-optimizer.py` - Quality metrics optimization
- `user_experience_optimizer.py` - UX optimization and analysis
- `continuous_improvement_system.py` - Continuous improvement automation

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run performance optimization
python internal/development/optimization/optimize.py

# Optimize quality metrics
python internal/development/optimization/quality-optimizer.py

# Continuous improvement analysis
python internal/development/optimization/continuous_improvement_system.py
```

### Development Tools (`tools/`)
**Purpose**: Utilities for framework development and maintenance

- `enhance-commands-prompt-construction.py` - Command enhancement tools
- `fix_documentation_formatting.py` - Documentation formatting fixes
- `fix_module_references.py` - Module reference repair tools
- `create_dependency_graph.py` - Dependency visualization tools
- `human_review_interface.py` - Human review workflow interface

**Usage**:
```bash
# Fix documentation formatting
python internal/development/tools/fix_documentation_formatting.py

# Create dependency graphs
python internal/development/tools/create_dependency_graph.py

# Launch human review interface
python internal/development/tools/human_review_interface.py
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Testing**: Use testing scripts to validate changes
2. **Optimization**: Run optimization scripts to improve performance
3. **Tools**: Use development tools for maintenance tasks
4. **Integration**: Ensure all changes pass framework validation

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Framework development dependencies
- Access to framework internals
- Understanding of framework architecture

## Notes

- These scripts are for framework development, not user operations
- Run all scripts from the project root directory
- Some scripts may modify framework files - use with caution
- Always backup before running optimization scripts
- Test thoroughly after using development tools
