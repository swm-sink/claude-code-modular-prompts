# Claude Code Integration Fix - EMERGENCY RESOLUTION

## Problem Identified

The custom framework commands (/task, /swarm, /auto, etc.) were not showing up in Claude Code because:

1. **Wrong Directory Structure**: Commands were in `.claude/prompt_eng/commands/` instead of the required `.claude/commands/`
2. **Wrong Format**: Commands were in complex XML format instead of simple markdown format expected by Claude Code
3. **Missing Integration**: Claude Code expects simple markdown files with clear instructions, not complex meta-prompting XML

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Proper Directory Structure
- Created `.claude/commands/` directory (Claude Code's expected location)
- Commands are now in the correct location for Claude Code to discover them

### 2. Converted Commands to Claude Code Format
Created simplified, functional versions of all essential commands:

- **`/task`** - Research-first focused development with TDD
- **`/swarm`** - Multi-component development with git worktree isolation  
- **`/auto`** - Intelligent routing with framework selection
- **`/query`** - Research and analysis for understanding codebases
- **`/docs`** - Documentation generation and management
- **`/session`** - Long-running session management with GitHub tracking
- **`/protocol`** - Production-ready protocol execution
- **`/feature`** - PRD-driven autonomous feature development
- **`/init`** - Framework initialization and project setup

### 3. Maintained Core Functionality
Each command maintains the essential functionality from the original framework:
- TDD enforcement
- Research-first approach
- Quality gates
- Production standards
- Appropriate routing logic

## How to Use

The commands should now be available in Claude Code. You can use them like:

```
/task "Add email validation to user registration"
/swarm "Implement complete user authentication system"
/auto "Help me optimize this database query"
/query "How does the authentication system work?"
/docs "Create API documentation for user service"
```

## Command Descriptions

### `/task` - Single Component Development
- Research-first approach
- Mandatory TDD cycle (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR)
- 90%+ test coverage requirement
- Quality gate validation

### `/swarm` - Multi-Component Development
- Git worktree isolation
- Agent coordination
- Multiple development streams
- Comprehensive integration testing

### `/auto` - Intelligent Routing
- Analyzes request complexity and scope
- Routes to optimal command automatically
- Framework selection intelligence
- Context-aware decision making

### `/query` - Research & Analysis
- Codebase analysis and understanding
- Pattern recognition
- Architecture mapping
- Research for subsequent development

### `/docs` - Documentation Generation
- Comprehensive documentation creation
- Multiple documentation types
- Audience-appropriate content
- Technical specification generation

### `/session` - Long-Running Work
- GitHub issue tracking
- Session management
- Progress tracking
- Context preservation

### `/protocol` - Production Deployment
- Strict quality gates
- Security threat modeling
- Production readiness validation
- Comprehensive testing requirements

### `/feature` - Feature Development
- PRD-driven development
- Feature planning and breakdown
- Integration testing
- Production readiness assessment

### `/init` - Project Setup
- Framework initialization
- Domain-specific configuration
- Testing setup
- Quality gate establishment

## Technical Details

### Original Issue
- Commands were in `.claude/prompt_eng/commands/core/` with complex XML format
- Claude Code expects simple markdown files in `.claude/commands/`
- The `$ARGUMENTS` keyword is used for parameter passing

### Resolution
- Created proper `.claude/commands/` directory structure
- Converted XML commands to simple markdown format
- Maintained core functionality while simplifying presentation
- Added clear instructions and examples for each command

## Verification

Commands should now be available in Claude Code's command palette. Test with:
```
/task "Test command integration"
```

If commands still don't appear, try:
1. Restart Claude Code
2. Check that files are in `/Users/smenssink/Documents/Github/claude-code-modular-prompts/.claude/commands/`
3. Verify files are properly formatted markdown

## Framework Integration

The original complex framework still exists in `.claude/prompt_eng/` and `.claude/modules/` for advanced users who want to access the full meta-prompting capabilities. The commands in `.claude/commands/` are simplified interfaces that delegate to the underlying framework modules.

## Next Steps

1. **Test Commands**: Try using the commands in Claude Code
2. **Customize**: Modify commands based on your specific needs
3. **Extend**: Add new commands following the same pattern
4. **Feedback**: Report any issues or missing functionality

The framework is now functional and integrated with Claude Code!
