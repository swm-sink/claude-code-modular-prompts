# Command Chain Test Scenarios

| Test ID | Pattern | Commands | Purpose | Expected Behavior |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| CC-001 | Sequential | /query → /feature → /task | Research-driven development | State passes between commands, each builds on previous |
| CC-002 | Parallel | /swarm with 3x /task | Multi-component development | Commands execute simultaneously, results consolidate |
| CC-003 | Conditional | /auto → dynamic routing | Adaptive workflow | Routes based on complexity analysis |
| CC-004 | Iterative | /task with quality criteria | Quality refinement | Repeats until 90% quality achieved |
| CC-005 | Mixed | Sequential + Parallel | Complex workflow | Combines patterns effectively |

## Test Case CC-001: Sequential Workflow

### Test Setup
```yaml
workflow_id: "auth_system_test"
pattern: "sequential"
commands:
  - /query: "Research authentication patterns"
  - /feature: "Design auth system based on research"
  - /task: "Implement auth system from PRD"
```

### Expected State Flow
1. **Query Output** → Feature Input
   - Research findings
   - Security requirements
   - Technology recommendations

2. **Feature Output** → Task Input
   - PRD specifications
   - Technical architecture
   - Implementation roadmap

3. **Task Output** → Final Result
   - Working implementation
   - Test coverage 90%+
   - Quality validation

### Validation Points
- [ ] State preserved between commands
- [ ] Atomic commits at each step
- [ ] Rollback capability verified
- [ ] Error propagation tested

  - /task: "Database models"
consolidation: "/session"
```

### Expected Behavior
1. **Swarm Coordination**
   - Agent assignments
   - Resource allocation
   - Conflict prevention

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Simultaneous task execution

## Test Case CC-003: Conditional Workflow

### Test Setup
```yaml
workflow_id: "adaptive_test"
pattern: "conditional"
start: "/auto"
routing_rules:
  - simple_task: "/task"
  - complex_requirements: "/query"
  - multi_component: "/swarm"
  - production_ready: "/protocol"
```

### Expected Behavior
1. **Auto Analysis**
   - Complexity assessment
   - Requirement analysis
   - Routing decision

2. **Dynamic Routing**
   - Correct command selection
   - Context adaptation
   - State preservation

3. **Execution Completion**
   - Appropriate workflow
   - Quality compliance
   - Documentation

### Validation Points
- [ ] Correct routing logic
- [ ] Context preservation
- [ ] Decision transparency
- [ ] Alternative paths work

## Test Case CC-004: Iterative Workflow

### Test Setup
```yaml
workflow_id: "quality_iteration_test"
pattern: "iterative"
command: "/task"
criteria:
  quality_threshold: 90
  coverage_threshold: 95
  max_iterations: 3
```

### Expected Behavior
1. **First Iteration**
   - Initial implementation
   - Quality measurement
   - Gap identification

2. **Subsequent Iterations**
   - Targeted improvements
   - Progressive quality increase
   - State accumulation

3. **Convergence**
   - Quality criteria met
   - Or max iterations reached
   - Final validation

### Validation Points
- [ ] Iteration tracking
- [ ] Quality improvement
- [ ] State accumulation
- [ ] Termination logic

## Test Case CC-005: Mixed Pattern Workflow

### Test Setup
```yaml
workflow_id: "complex_workflow_test"
pattern: "mixed"
structure:
  - sequential:
    - /query: "System analysis"
    - /auto: "Complexity routing"
  - conditional:
    - if complex: parallel_development
    - else: simple_task
  - parallel_development:
    - /swarm: "Coordinate agents"
    - parallel:
      - /task: "Component A"
      - /task: "Component B"
  - consolidation:
    - /session: "Integration"
    - /protocol: "Deployment"
```

### Expected Behavior
- Sequential analysis phase
- Conditional complexity routing
- Parallel development if needed
- Final consolidation and deployment

### Validation Points
- [ ] Pattern transitions smooth
- [ ] State maintained throughout
- [ ] Complex orchestration works
- [ ] Quality gates enforced

## Error Scenarios

### ES-001: Command Failure
- Command 2 of 3 fails in sequential workflow
- Expected: Rollback to command 1 state
- Validation: State integrity preserved

### ES-002: Partial Parallel Failure
- 1 of 3 parallel commands fails
- Expected: Other 2 complete, failure documented
- Validation: Graceful degradation

### ES-003: Timeout in Iterative
- Iteration takes too long
- Expected: Timeout, preserve best result
- Validation: No infinite loops

### ES-004: Resource Conflict
- Parallel commands compete for resources
- Expected: Resource allocation manages conflict
- Validation: No deadlocks

## Performance Metrics

### Target Performance
- Sequential overhead: < 5% per command
- Parallel efficiency: > 80% speedup
- State management: < 1KB per command
- Rollback time: < 2 seconds

### Measurement Points
1. Command transition time
2. State preservation cost
3. Parallel coordination overhead
4. Error recovery time
5. Total workflow duration
