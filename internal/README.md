# Internal Development Files

This directory contains all development artifacts, tools, and reports that are not part of the user-facing framework experience.

## Directory Structure

- **agents/** - Multi-agent Python scripts used for framework development and validation
- **analysis/** - JSON analysis results and data files from development processes  
- **reports/** - Consolidated agent reports, certification documents, analysis files, and technical documentation
- **development/** - Development-focused scripts (testing, optimization, tools)
- **validation/** - Quality assurance and validation scripts
- **monitoring/** - Production monitoring and health checking scripts

## Purpose

These files support the framework development and validation process but are not needed for normal framework usage. Users should focus on the root-level documentation and the `.claude/` framework structure.

**Note**: All scattered reports and development documentation have been consolidated into the `reports/` directory with logical organization by purpose and audience.

## Scripts Organization

### Development Scripts (`development/`)
**Purpose**: Framework development, testing, and optimization
- `testing/` - Testing frameworks and validation tools
- `optimization/` - Performance and quality optimization scripts
- `tools/` - Development utilities and maintenance tools

### Validation Scripts (`validation/`)
**Purpose**: Quality assurance and framework compliance validation
- Core validation tools and compliance checking
- Automated QA pipelines and quality assessment
- Framework standards validation and enforcement

### Monitoring Scripts (`monitoring/`)
**Purpose**: Production monitoring, health checking, and operational excellence
- Real-time health monitoring and alerting
- Production deployment and rollback automation
- Performance dashboards and metrics collection

## For Developers

If you're working on framework development or need to understand the internal architecture, these files provide comprehensive insights into the multi-agent development process and validation results.

See individual README files in each subdirectory for detailed documentation on specific script categories.
