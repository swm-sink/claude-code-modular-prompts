# Internal Development Files

This directory contains all development artifacts, tools, and reports that are not part of the user-facing framework experience.

## Directory Structure

- **agents/** - Multi-agent Python scripts used for framework development and validation
- **analysis/** - JSON analysis results and data files from development processes  
- **reports/** - Agent completion reports, certification documents, and summaries
- **artifacts/** - Development artifacts, migration reports, and technical documentation

## Purpose

These files support the framework development and validation process but are not needed for normal framework usage. Users should focus on the root-level documentation and the `.claude/` framework structure.

## For Developers

If you're working on framework development or need to understand the internal architecture, these files provide comprehensive insights into the multi-agent development process and validation results.
