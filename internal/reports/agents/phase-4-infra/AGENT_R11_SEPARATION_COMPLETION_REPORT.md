.gitignore            # Comprehensive exclusions
```

**User Areas** (Clean and focused):
```
config/               # Framework configuration for users
docs/                 # User-focused documentation with learning paths
examples/             # Progressive complexity examples  
scripts/              # User-operational scripts only
tests/                # Framework testing infrastructure
.claude/              # Framework core (291 files, 35 directories)
```

### 2. Development Infrastructure Verification - **PRESERVED** ‚úÖ

**internal/** Structure (Complete toolkit):
```
agents/               # 25+ development agent scripts
analysis/             # Organized metrics and results  
artifacts/            # Development configurations
development/          # Core development tools (49 Python tools)
monitoring/           # Production infrastructure
reports/              # Comprehensive reporting (46 documentation files)
validation/           # Quality assurance systems
