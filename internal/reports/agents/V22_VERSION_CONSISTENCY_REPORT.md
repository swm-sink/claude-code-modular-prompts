# Agent V22 Version Consistency Report

**Agent**: V22 - Version Consistency Checker  
**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  

## Executive Summary

Initial discovery phase completed. Framework version 3.0.0 is mostly consistent throughout the codebase, with some specific patterns identified:

1. Framework components correctly use version 3.0.0
2. PROJECT_CONFIG.xml files consistently use version 1.0.0 (this appears intentional)
3. Some subsystems like `<project_customization>` and `<command_chaining>` use version 1.0.0
4. All modules checked so far use framework version 3.0.0 (not independent 1.x.x as CLAUDE.md suggests)

## Findings

### ‚úÖ Correct Version 3.0.0 References

1. **CLAUDE.md**
   - Main version table: 3.0.0 ‚úì
   - `<framework version = "3.0.0">` ‚úì
   - Multiple subsystem versions correctly set to 3.0.0

2. **Documentation**
   - docs/guides/USER_GUIDE.md: 3.0.0 ‚úì
   - docs/user-guide/commands/overview.md: 3.0.0 ‚úì
   - README.md: Version badge shows 3.0.0 ‚úì
   - CHANGELOG.md: Latest version is 3.0.0 ‚úì

3. **Commands**
   - .claude/commands/auto.md: 3.0.0 ‚úì
   - All command files appear to use framework version

4. **Modules**
   - .claude/modules/development/task-management.md: 3.0.0 ‚úì
   - .claude/modules/patterns/intelligent-routing.md: 3.0.0 ‚úì
   - Modules are using framework version, not independent versioning

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Version 1.0.0 References (Intentional?)

1. **PROJECT_CONFIG.xml Files**
   - All PROJECT_CONFIG.xml files use `version="1.0.0"`
   - This appears to be the configuration schema version, not framework version
   - Consistent across all examples and templates

2. **Subsystem Versions in CLAUDE.md**
   - `<project_customization version = "1.0.0">` 
   - `<command_chaining version = "1.0.0">`
   - These appear to be subsystem-specific versions

### üîç Potential Issues

1. **Module Versioning Discrepancy**
   - CLAUDE.md states: "Modules are modular components with independent evolution"
   - CLAUDE.md suggests modules should use "1.x.x" versioning
   - Reality: All modules checked use framework version 3.0.0
   - This needs clarification or correction

2. **Version Strategy Documentation**
   - CLAUDE.md has a `<versioning_strategy>` section that explains the approach
   - Module versioning strategy may need to be implemented or documentation updated

## Next Steps

1. Determine if module versioning should be independent (1.x.x) or aligned with framework (3.0.0)
2. Check remaining documentation files for version consistency
3. Create validation script to ensure version consistency going forward
4. Update any incorrect references found

## Files Requiring Further Investigation

- Additional module files (100+ to check)
- Documentation in various subdirectories
- Test files with version references
- Script files with version constants
