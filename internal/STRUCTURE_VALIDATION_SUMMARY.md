## 📊 Separation Validation

### Development Artifacts Moved to Internal
- ✅ `archive/analytics/*.json` → `internal/analysis/quality/`
- ✅ All agent scripts in `internal/agents/`
- ✅ All development tools in `internal/development/`
- ✅ All monitoring scripts in `internal/monitoring/`
- ✅ All analysis data organized in `internal/analysis/`
- ✅ All reports structured in `internal/reports/`

### User Experience Protection
