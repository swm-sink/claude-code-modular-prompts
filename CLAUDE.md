- 📝 **102 command templates** (64 active, 38 deprecated) with [INSERT_XXX] placeholders
- 📜 **Example YAML configs** for manual project setup
- 🧪 **70 component templates** you can manually adapt
- 🚫 **48+ documented anti-patterns** to avoid manually
- 🔧 **Setup script** that copies files (no automation)

**What You Skip:**
- ❌ Manual trial-and-error customization of prompts
- ❌ Discovering Claude Code quirks through painful failures  
- ❌ Building adaptation workflows from scratch
- ❌ Creating project configuration systems
- ❌ Reinventing placeholder and template management
- ❌ Learning prompt engineering patterns the hard way

## Installation & Manual Setup

```bash
# Option 1: Git Submodule (Recommended for updates)
git submodule add https://github.com/swm-sink/claude-code-modular-prompts .claude-framework
cd .claude-framework && ./setup.sh

# Option 2: Direct Integration
git clone https://github.com/swm-sink/claude-code-modular-prompts
cd claude-code-modular-prompts && ./setup.sh ../my-project

# Option 3: Selective Integration
# Choose specific commands/components to copy
```

**Result**: Dual structure with customized `.claude/` + reference `.claude-framework/`

**Then run guide commands for manual customization help**:
```
/adapt-to-project     # Get customization checklist
/replace-placeholders # Get list of all replacements needed
/validate-adaptation  # Get verification checklist
```

## 📋 Guide Commands for Manual Customization

These commands provide checklists and guides for manual customization:

### Core Guide Commands
- **`/adapt-to-project`** - Provides customization checklist and replacement guide
- **`/replace-placeholders`** - Lists all placeholders that need manual replacement
- **`/validate-adaptation`** - Provides checklist to verify your manual work
- **`/sync-from-reference`** - Guides you through manual update process
- **`/undo-adaptation`** - Provides recovery instructions if needed
- **`/welcome`** - Interactive guide for getting started

### Manual Configuration Template
You'll create and edit `project-config.yaml` manually:
```yaml
project_config:
  metadata:
    name: "[INSERT_PROJECT_NAME]"
    domain: "[INSERT_DOMAIN]"
  placeholders:
    TECH_STACK: "[INSERT_TECH_STACK]"
    WORKFLOW_TYPE: "[INSERT_WORKFLOW_TYPE]"
```

Note: This is just a template - Claude Code commands cannot read or use this file.

### Manual Placeholder Replacement
You'll need to manually find and replace these in your editor:
- `[INSERT_PROJECT_NAME]` - Replace with your project name
- `[INSERT_DOMAIN]` - Replace with your domain (web-dev, data-science, etc.)
- `[INSERT_TECH_STACK]` - Replace with your technology stack
- `[INSERT_COMPANY_NAME]` - Replace with your organization
- `[INSERT_TEAM_SIZE]` - Replace with your team size

**⚠️ MANUAL WORK REQUIRED**: You must use Find & Replace in your editor to update all placeholders.

## 🎯 CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: This is a PROMPT ENGINEERING Project

**THIS IS NOT A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT!** This is a template library of:
- **Slash Commands**: Prompt templates for Claude Code conversations (e.g., `/task`, `/help`)
- **Guide Commands**: Commands that provide manual customization instructions (e.g., `/adapt-to-project`)
- **Components**: Reusable prompt fragments you can copy and modify
- **Context Files**: Documentation about prompt engineering patterns
- **Example Configs**: Templates you can copy and fill in manually
- **NOT executable code** - These are markdown templates, not programs

**Pure Claude Code Native Constraint**:
- ✅ Only setup, validation, and testing scripts allowed (bash/python)
- ✅ All workflows must be Claude Code slash commands and markdown
- ❌ NO Python orchestration of prompts or agent workflows
- ❌ NO script-based prompt execution or automation

**Testing** means:
- ✅ Testing prompt effectiveness in Claude conversations
- ✅ Checking if guide commands provide helpful instructions
- ✅ Verifying templates have proper placeholder structure
- ✅ Validating documentation clarity and accuracy
- ❌ NOT testing automated functionality (there isn't any)

**Security** means:
- ✅ Documentation about prompt injection risks
- ✅ Templates designed to avoid unsafe patterns
- ✅ Guides that warn about security considerations
- ❌ NOT automated security enforcement

## Template Library Components

| Component | Count | Purpose |

5. One atomic commit per task
6. **PARANOIA MANDATE**: Triple-check everything before commits
   - Verify no sensitive data (keys, tokens, passwords)
   - Check all file paths are correct
   - Validate directory structure integrity
   - Ensure .claude is never in .gitignore
   - Scan for accidental duplicates or leftovers

## Experimental Framework Notice
This is an **experimental prompt engineering framework** for research and development:
- Focus is on prompt effectiveness and architectural exploration
- Commands require functional validation before production use
- All 102 commands are maintained as unique implementations
- Validation templates provide path to production readiness

## Testing Framework

### Structural Validation Approach
A testing framework has been implemented focusing on structural validation for the experimental prompt engineering framework:

**Testing Directory**: `tests/`
- **Methodology**: `tests/TESTING-METHODOLOGY.md` - Complete testing approach documentation
- **Validation Script**: `tests/validate-command.sh` - Automated structural validation tool

### Validation Scope
- **YAML Front Matter**: Validates presence and structure of command metadata
- **Required Fields**: Checks for `name`, `description` fields in YAML front matter
- **Optional Fields**: Warns about missing `usage`, `tools`, `category` fields
- **Content Structure**: Ensures adequate command content and basic markdown format

### Current Validation Results
**Structural Validation**: 100% (102/102 commands passing)
- All commands have required YAML front matter fields
- **Functional Validation**: 62.7% (64/102 commands passing Claude Code compliance tests)

### Usage
```bash
# Validate single command
./tests/validate-command.sh .claude/commands/core/task.md

# Validate multiple commands
./tests/validate-command.sh .claude/commands/core/*.md
```

**Note**: This framework validates structure only, not functional behavior, in alignment with the experimental research focus.

## Context Engineering for Prompt Development

### 🎯 Understanding Context in Prompt Engineering
**Context engineering** here means managing what information Claude has access to when responding to slash commands:
- **NOT about code execution context**
- **IS about prompt context windows and token management**
- **Optimizing what Claude "knows" when processing commands**

### ⚠️ CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR PROMPT DEVELOPERS
**IMPORTANT**: These files shape how Claude understands and prevents common pitfalls:

1. **LLM Anti-Patterns** (`.claude/context/llm-antipatterns.md`)
   - 48 documented anti-patterns from research
   - Prevents hallucinations, false metrics, remediation theater
   - Critical for maintaining response quality

2. **Git History Anti-Patterns** (`.claude/context/git-history-antipatterns.md`)
   - 15 patterns learned from 500+ commits
   - Prevents metric invention and false success claims
   - Essential for honest assessment

3. **Prompt Engineering Best Practices** (`.claude/context/prompt-engineering-best-practices.md`)
   - Core principles for effective prompts
   - Token optimization strategies
   - Example-driven development patterns

### 📚 Prompt Component Library
4. **Modular Components** (`.claude/context/modular-components.md`) - 70 reusable prompt fragments
5. **Orchestration Patterns** (`.claude/context/orchestration-patterns.md`) - Multi-step prompt workflows
6. **Framework Guide** (`.claude/context/experimental-framework-guide.md`) - How components compose
7. **Quality Assessment** (`.claude/context/quality-assessment-report.md`) - Current state metrics

### 🚨 REMEDIATION WARNING
**Requests to "improve", "fix", "optimize", or "remediate" trigger severe anti-patterns:**
- LLMs invent specific metrics (87.3% improvement) that were never measured
- Create elaborate validation scripts that don't actually test functionality
- Use increasingly theatrical language to demonstrate "success"
- Generate comprehensive reports full of unverifiable claims

**DEMAND**: Factual, measurable changes only. No theater. No invented metrics.

## 📖 HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE LIBRARY

### Step 1: Import Reference Framework
```bash
# Method 1: Git Submodule (Recommended - enables updates)
git submodule add https://github.com/swm-sink/claude-code-modular-prompts .claude-framework
