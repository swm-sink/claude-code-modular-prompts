# Claude Code Modular Prompts - Template Library

## üîÑ DEVELOPMENT APPROACH UPDATE (2025-07-30)

### Previous Approach: SIMPLICITY MANDATE (2025-07-29)
The project previously enforced a strict SIMPLICITY MANDATE to prevent over-engineering after multiple failed attempts at complex architectures. This mandate banned:
- Planning orchestration with agents
- Multi-phase execution strategies
- Quality gates and validation frameworks
- Any architectures, patterns, or abstractions

**Why it existed**: Previous attempts at complex frameworks resulted in:
- "We built a prompt engineering framework pretending to be software"
- "Current completion: 30% of vision"
- Multiple abandoned orchestration systems
- Over-promised automation that didn't work

### Current Approach: COMPREHENSIVE ENGINEERING (2025-07-30)
The project now allows comprehensive planning and engineering approaches including:
- ‚úÖ Multi-branch analysis (ultrathink with 20+ branches)
- ‚úÖ Detailed planning phases with critique cycles
- ‚úÖ Quality gates and validation frameworks
- ‚úÖ Test-driven development (TDD)
- ‚úÖ Atomic commit strategies
- ‚úÖ Sub-agent coordination and orchestration
- ‚úÖ 100+ step implementation plans

### Development Standards
- **World-class content**: Referenced, verified, no hallucinations
- **Thorough validation**: Multiple review and edit cycles
- **Comprehensive testing**: TDD approach for all components
- **Atomic commits**: Clear, focused changes
- **Sub-agent coordination**: Detailed prompts and planning
- **Web research integration**: Fact-checking and best practices

### Historical Context
**Previous Complex Attempts** (preserved for learning):
- ULTRATHINK framework assessment
- Multi-agent orchestration attempts
- Various abandoned automation systems

**What Changed**: Decision to pursue comprehensive engineering despite previous failures, with emphasis on:
1. Learning from past mistakes
2. More thorough planning and validation
3. World-class quality standards
4. Proper sub-agent coordination

## üéØ CLAUDE CODE NATIVE UNDERSTANDING

### Core Claude Code Concepts (Research-Based)
- **Slash Commands**: .md files in .claude/commands/ with YAML frontmatter (name, description, usage, allowed-tools)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project memory that persists across sessions - critical for context engineering
- **Settings.json**: Configuration for tools, permissions, hooks (.claude/settings.json or ~/.claude/settings.json)
- **Context Engineering**: Managing what Claude knows and when - optimize token usage and performance
- **Sub-agents**: Specialized AI assistants for specific tasks (.claude/agents/ directory)
- **MCP Tools**: Model Context Protocol for filesystem/memory access and external integrations

### Key Claude Code Features for This Project
- **Hooks**: Automate workflows (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, Notification) - enables true automation
- **Headless Mode**: CI/CD integration with `claude -p "prompt"` and `--output-format stream-json`
- **Framework Detection**: Scan package.json, requirements.txt, etc. for auto-configuration  
- **Meta-prompting**: Use Claude to generate better prompts and improve templates
- **Token Optimization**: Use /clear, /compact, manage context window efficiently
- **Permission System**: Read-only by default, explicit permission for file operations
- **Team Collaboration**: Commands shared via git, consistent workflows across teams

### True Automation Opportunities (Not Theater)
Based on 50+ research sources, these are proven automation patterns:
1. **File scanning** to detect project type (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
2. **Automatic placeholder replacement** based on detected frameworks
3. **Hook-based workflows** that run automatically on file changes
4. **CI/CD integration** for team deployment and validation
5. **Sub-agent workflows** for parallel processing and specialization
6. **MCP filesystem integration** for persistent memory and file management

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid (Research-Validated)
- ‚ùå **False automation promises** - If it says automated, it must actually work
- ‚ùå **Placeholder pollution** - Commands with [INSERT_XXX] that break workflows
- ‚ùå **Context window bloat** - Loading irrelevant history that degrades performance
- ‚ùå **Token waste** - Inefficient prompt patterns that consume unnecessary tokens
- ‚ùå **Manual masquerading as automation** - Scripts that just provide instructions

## üîß TEMPLATE LIBRARY MAINTENANCE STANDARDS

### Structural Integrity Requirements
- **Commands directory**: ONLY .md files allowed (no scripts, reports, or binaries)
- **YAML frontmatter**: Consistent field names (`usage`, `allowed-tools` - never `argument-hint`, `tools`)
- **No duplicates**: Zero duplicate command names across all directories
- **Accurate counts**: Documentation must reflect actual file counts at all times
- **Proper categorization**: Commands placed in correct directory (core, quality, specialized, etc.)

### Quality Control Checkpoints
- **Pre-commit validation**: Verify file placement and YAML consistency before any changes
- **Regular audits**: Check for duplicate commands and misplaced files monthly
- **Documentation sync**: Update counts immediately after any structural changes
- **YAML compliance**: All commands must have standardized frontmatter

### Critical Issues Learned (NEVER REPEAT)
- ‚ùå **Non-MD files in commands directory** - Python scripts, shell scripts, reports belong elsewhere
- ‚ùå **Duplicate command names** - Creates confusion about which version to use
- ‚ùå **Inconsistent YAML fields** - Use `usage` not `argument-hint`, `tools` not `allowed-tools`
- ‚ùå **Inaccurate command counts** - Documentation must always reflect actual file counts (currently 88 total)
- ‚ùå **Commands in wrong categories** - Misplaced files make discovery impossible
- ‚ùå **Deprecated directories** - If consolidated, remove deprecated versions completely

### Validation Procedures
1. **File type check**: `find .claude/commands -type f ! -name "*.md"` should return empty
2. **YAML consistency**: All active commands must use standard field names
3. **Count verification**: `find .claude/commands -name "*.md" | wc -l` must match documentation
4. **Duplicate detection**: No command basename should appear in multiple directories
5. **Category validation**: Commands placed in logical directories by function

### Maintenance Commands
- **Structure check**: Use `/validate-adaptation` to verify template integrity
- **Count update**: Update CLAUDE.md immediately after any file changes
- **YAML validation**: Use validation scripts to check frontmatter consistency

**THESE STANDARDS ARE MANDATORY - VIOLATION REQUIRES IMMEDIATE CLEANUP**

    name: "[INSERT_PROJECT_NAME]"
    domain: "[INSERT_DOMAIN]"
  placeholders:
    TECH_STACK: "[INSERT_TECH_STACK]"
    WORKFLOW_TYPE: "[INSERT_WORKFLOW_TYPE]"
```

Note: This is just a template - Claude Code commands cannot read or use this file.

### Manual Placeholder Replacement
You'll need to manually find and replace these in your editor:
- `[INSERT_PROJECT_NAME]` - Replace with your project name
- `[INSERT_DOMAIN]` - Replace with your domain (web-dev, data-science, etc.)
- `[INSERT_TECH_STACK]` - Replace with your technology stack
- `[INSERT_COMPANY_NAME]` - Replace with your organization

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANUAL WORK REQUIRED**: You must use Find & Replace in your editor to update all placeholders.

## üéØ CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: This is a PROMPT ENGINEERING Project

**THIS IS NOT A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT!** This is a template library of:
- **Slash Commands**: Prompt templates for Claude Code conversations (e.g., `/task`, `/help`)
- **Guide Commands**: Commands that provide manual customization instructions (e.g., `/adapt-to-project`)
- **Components**: Reusable prompt fragments you can copy and modify
- **Context Files**: Documentation about prompt engineering patterns
- **Example Configs**: Templates you can copy and fill in manually
- **NOT executable code** - These are markdown templates, not programs

**Pure Claude Code Native Constraint**:
- ‚úÖ Only setup, validation, and testing scripts allowed (bash/python)
- ‚úÖ All workflows must be Claude Code slash commands and markdown
- ‚ùå NO Python orchestration of prompts or agent workflows
- ‚ùå NO script-based prompt execution or automation

**Testing** means:
- ‚úÖ Testing prompt effectiveness in Claude conversations
- ‚úÖ Checking if guide commands provide helpful instructions
- ‚úÖ Verifying templates have proper placeholder structure
- ‚úÖ Validating documentation clarity and accuracy
- ‚ùå NOT testing automated functionality (there isn't any)

**Security** means:
- ‚úÖ Documentation about prompt injection risks
- ‚úÖ Templates designed to avoid unsafe patterns
- ‚úÖ Guides that warn about security considerations
- ‚ùå NOT automated security enforcement

## Experimental Framework Notice
This is an **experimental prompt engineering framework** for research and development:
- Focus is on prompt effectiveness and architectural exploration
- Commands require functional validation before production use
- All 88 commands are maintained as unique implementations
- Validation templates provide path to production readiness

## Testing Framework

### Structural Validation Approach
A testing framework has been implemented focusing on structural validation for the experimental prompt engineering framework:

**Testing Directory**: `tests/`
- **Methodology**: `tests/TESTING-METHODOLOGY.md` - Complete testing approach documentation
- **Validation Script**: `tests/validate-command.sh` - Automated structural validation tool

### Validation Scope
- **YAML Front Matter**: Validates presence and structure of command metadata
- **Required Fields**: Checks for `name`, `description` fields in YAML front matter
- **Optional Fields**: Warns about missing `usage`, `allowed-tools`, `category` fields
- **Content Structure**: Ensures adequate command content and basic markdown format

### Current Validation Results
**Structural Validation**: 100% (88/88 commands passing)
- All commands have required YAML front matter fields
- **Functional Validation**: 100% (88/88 commands passing Claude Code compliance tests)

### Usage
```bash
# Validate single command
./tests/validate-command.sh .claude/commands/core/task.md

# Validate multiple commands
./tests/validate-command.sh .claude/commands/core/*.md
```

**Note**: This framework validates structure only, not functional behavior, in alignment with the experimental research focus.

## Context Engineering for Prompt Development

### üéØ Understanding Context in Prompt Engineering
**Context engineering** here means managing what information Claude has access to when responding to slash commands:
- **NOT about code execution context**
- **IS about prompt context windows and token management**
- **Optimizing what Claude "knows" when processing commands**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR PROMPT DEVELOPERS
**IMPORTANT**: These files shape how Claude understands and prevents common pitfalls:

1. **LLM Anti-Patterns** (`.claude/context/llm-antipatterns.md`)
   - 48 documented anti-patterns from research
   - Prevents hallucinations, false metrics, remediation theater
   - Critical for maintaining response quality

2. **Git History Anti-Patterns** (`.claude/context/git-history-antipatterns.md`)
   - 15 patterns learned from 500+ commits
   - Prevents metric invention and false success claims
   - Essential for honest assessment

3. **Prompt Engineering Best Practices** (`.claude/context/prompt-engineering-best-practices.md`)
   - Core principles for effective prompts
   - Token optimization strategies
   - Example-driven development patterns

### üìö Prompt Component Library
4. **Modular Components** (`.claude/context/modular-components.md`) - 70 reusable prompt fragments
5. **Orchestration Patterns** (`.claude/context/orchestration-patterns.md`) - Multi-step prompt workflows
6. **Framework Guide** (`.claude/context/experimental-framework-guide.md`) - How components compose
7. **Quality Assessment** (`.claude/context/quality-assessment-report.md`) - Current state metrics

### üéì COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT LEARNINGS
8. **Comprehensive Project Learnings** (`.claude/context/comprehensive-project-learnings.md`)
   - **CRITICAL**: Real-world validation of anti-patterns through this project's own development
   - Maintenance risks, scalability breakpoints, and future-proofing timeline
   - Evidence-based insights from 20-step, 50-step, and comprehensive project reviews
   - **Key Learning**: Project demonstrated the exact anti-patterns it warns against
   - Actionable recommendations for template library maintainers and Claude Code projects

### üö® REMEDIATION WARNING
**Requests to "improve", "fix", "optimize", or "remediate" trigger severe anti-patterns:**
- LLMs invent specific metrics (87.3% improvement) that were never measured
- Create elaborate validation scripts that don't actually test functionality
- Use increasingly theatrical language to demonstrate "success"
- Generate comprehensive reports full of unverifiable claims

**DEMAND**: Factual, measurable changes only. No theater. No invented metrics.

## üìö LIBRARY PRESERVATION STRATEGY

### Why ALL Content Matters in a Template Library

**Core Principle**: In a template library, seemingly "scattered" content is often valuable reference material:

- **Reports & Documentation**: Show real-world template usage patterns and evolution
- **Anti-patterns**: Prevent users from making documented mistakes  
- **Research Materials**: Provide context for why templates were designed certain ways
- **Deprecated Templates**: Serve as historical reference and migration guides
- **Context Files**: Essential for understanding prompt engineering principles
- **Test Results**: Validate template effectiveness and guide improvements

### Organization vs Deletion Philosophy

**‚úÖ LIBRARY ORGANIZATION** (What We Do):
- Catalog and categorize all 88 command templates
- Make 94 components easily discoverable  
- Organize documentation by access patterns
- Create clear navigation paths to content
- Preserve all research and learning materials
- Maintain historical context and evolution

**‚ùå AGGRESSIVE CLEANUP** (What We Avoid):
- Deleting "duplicate" templates (might serve different use cases)
- Removing "outdated" documentation (valuable for understanding evolution) 
- Throwing away reports (contain usage insights)
- Eliminating context files (essential for prompt engineering)
- Purging template variants (different use cases may need different approaches)

### Template Library Success Metrics

1. **Accessibility**: Can users quickly find relevant templates?
2. **Completeness**: Are all use cases covered by available templates?
3. **Context**: Do users understand when/why to use each template?
4. **Evolution**: Can users see how templates developed over time?
5. **Prevention**: Are anti-patterns clearly documented to avoid common mistakes?
