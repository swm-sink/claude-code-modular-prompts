# Evidence Validation System - Deep Discovery Quality Assurance
**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: 2025-08-07  
**Purpose**: Rigorous evidence validation system ensuring only high-quality patterns enter consultation system

## Overview

The Evidence Validation System implements comprehensive CRAAP (Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, Purpose) testing with confidence scoring to ensure every pattern extracted for our 30-60 minute deep discovery consultation meets rigorous quality standards. This system differentiates REAL EVIDENCE from assumptions and hopes.
