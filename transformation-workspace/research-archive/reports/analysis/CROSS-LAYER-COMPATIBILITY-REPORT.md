- Layer 3: Expose all complexity (5% get maximum power)

### 2. Natural User Flow ✅
**User-Driven Discovery**: Users discover complexity as they need it
- No forced learning of advanced concepts
- Clear benefit/cost tradeoff at each level
- Natural progression based on actual needs

### 3. Bi-Directional Flow ✅
**Escalation & De-escalation**: Users can move up or down complexity levels
- Up: When they need more control
- Down: When they want simplicity
- Sideways: Different complexity for different tasks

### 4. Data Consistency ✅
**Seamless Transitions**: No data loss or format incompatibilities
- Consistent YAML frontmatter across layers
- Compatible command structures
- Preserved user context and intent
