# The Claude Code Prompt Factory

**A comprehensive, enterprise-grade AI development platform that scales from simple tasks to global deployment while maintaining elegant simplicity.**

This repository provides a world-class toolkit of intelligently crafted prompt-based commands that can be easily adapted to any project through a central `PROJECT_CONFIG.xml` file. From startup prototypes to enterprise applications, it offers the right level of sophistication for every use case.

## 🚀 Core Principles

*   **Simplicity First**: Each command has a single, focused purpose with minimal cognitive overhead
*   **Smart Routing**: The `/auto` command intelligently selects the best approach for any request
*   **Enterprise Ready**: Advanced capabilities for global deployment, compliance, and scale
*   **Claude Native**: Pure XML architecture leveraging Claude's full intelligence without external dependencies

## ✨ Key Features

### **Core Capabilities**
*   **Intelligent Onboarding**: Use `/existing` to automatically scan your project and generate configuration
*   **Smart Command Routing**: `/auto "your request"` analyzes intent and routes to optimal commands
*   **Safety Protocols**: The `/protocol` command provides rigorous workflows for critical changes
*   **Adaptive Thinking**: 200K token context optimization with persistent memory

### **Enterprise Features**
*   **Global Deployment**: Multi-region deployment with cultural intelligence and localization
*   **Industry Compliance**: HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR, SOX, and other regulatory frameworks
*   **Security Excellence**: OWASP 2025 compliance with enterprise-grade security patterns
*   **Quality Assurance**: Mutation testing, circuit breakers, and anti-pattern detection

### **Advanced Intelligence**
*   **Emerging Technologies**: AR/VR, IoT, blockchain, quantum computing integration
*   **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Swarm intelligence and DAG orchestration
*   **Academic Research**: Publication-ready implementations with peer-review standards
*   **Ecosystem Growth**: Platform economics and marketplace expansion strategies

## 🔧 Quick Start

1.  **Copy the framework** to your project's `.claude` directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p .claude
    cp -r claude_prompt_factory .claude/
    ```

2.  **Initialize for your project**:
    ```bash
    /existing    # For existing projects (auto-detects tech stack)
    # OR
    /new         # For new projects (guided setup)
    ```

3.  **Start with core commands**:
    ```bash
    /auto "fix the login authentication issue"
    /task "create email validation utility" 
    /query "how does user authentication work?"
    ```

4.  **Scale to enterprise capabilities**:
    ```bash
    /global-deploy "US,EU,APAC" --strategy=blue-green
    /industry-adapt "healthcare" --compliance=strict
    /emerging-tech "blockchain" --maturity=enterprise
    ```

## 🎯 Usage Patterns by Scale

### **Individual Developer**
