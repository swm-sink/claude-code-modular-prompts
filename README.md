# The Claude Code Prompt Factory

**A modular, shareable, and comprehensive library of prompt-based commands that feel native to the Claude Code environment.**

This repository provides a powerful toolkit of generalized, prompt-based commands that can be easily adapted to any project. It is not a complex, coded framework; it is a factory for producing high-quality, reusable commands that extend the capabilities of Claude Code.

## üöÄ Core Principles

*   **Simplicity**: Each command has a single, well-defined purpose.
*   **Consistency**: All commands follow a standard, predictable structure.
*   **Modularity**: Commands are self-contained and easy to understand and modify.
*   **Prompt-Driven**: The entire system is built on the power of prompts, making it easy to extend and adapt.

## üìÅ The Prompt Factory

All of the commands and their documentation are located in the `claude_prompt_factory` directory. This directory is the heart of the project, and it is designed to be easily copied into any project.

The single source of truth for all commands is the `claude_prompt_factory/CLAUDE.md` file. This file provides a comprehensive overview of all available commands, organized by category.

## üîß Getting Started

1.  **Copy the `claude_prompt_factory` directory** to your project's `.claude` directory.
2.  **Create a `PROJECT_CONFIG.xml`** in your project's root to configure the commands for your specific tech stack.
3.  **Explore the available commands** in `claude_prompt_factory/CLAUDE.md`.
4.  **Start using the commands!**

For a detailed guide, see the [GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) file.

## ü§ù Contributing

This is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions! If you have a command that you think would be a great addition to the "Prompt Factory," please see our [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for instructions on how to contribute.

*This project is built on the principle that the best way to extend an LLM-powered tool is with the LLM's own language: prompts.*
