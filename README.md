# Claude Code Modular Agents

A comprehensive modular agent system that integrates with the Claude Framework for enhanced AI development orchestration.

## Overview

This repository provides advanced modular agent patterns and templates that extend the Claude Framework's native multi-agent capabilities using Task() and Batch() patterns.

## Integration with Claude Framework

This system is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Claude Framework v2.0.0, providing:

- **Enhanced Agent Templates** - Pre-configured agent roles and specializations
- **Advanced Coordination Patterns** - Complex multi-agent workflows
- **Session Management Integration** - Deep GitHub integration for tracking
- **Quality Modules** - Specialized modules for security, performance, and testing
- **Deployment Patterns** - Production-ready agent orchestration

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have the Claude Framework v2.0.0 installed
2. Clone this repository into your project
3. Use the enhanced `/swarm` command with modular agent templates
4. Leverage pre-built workflows for common development scenarios

## Usage Examples

### Using Enhanced Agent Templates
```bash
# Use specialized agent roles from templates
/swarm "Build microservices platform" --agents=architects/system,specialists/security,engineers/backend
```

### Applying Workflow Templates
```bash
# Use pre-built migration workflow
/swarm "Migrate to microservices" --workflow=migration/monolith-to-microservices
```

### Advanced Coordination Patterns
```bash
# Use hierarchical coordination for complex projects
/swarm "Enterprise platform redesign" --pattern=hierarchical/lead-architect
```

## Integration Points

- **Claude Framework Commands**: Extends `/swarm`, `/task`, and `/auto` commands
- **Session Management**: Enhanced GitHub session templates and tracking
- **Quality Modules**: Integrates with existing security, performance, and TDD modules
- **Documentation**: Automated documentation generation for multi-agent projects

## Development Status

This repository is actively being developed to provide world-class modular agent capabilities for the Claude Framework ecosystem.
