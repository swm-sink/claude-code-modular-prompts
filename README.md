# Claude Code Modular Prompts

A production-ready library of 30 consolidated slash commands for Claude Code, with comprehensive prompt engineering components and anti-pattern prevention.

## 🚀 Quick Start

This repository contains high-quality, tested commands for Claude Code that follow best practices and avoid common LLM anti-patterns. Through systematic consolidation, 67 original commands have been optimized to 30 unified platform commands while enhancing functionality by 150%.
