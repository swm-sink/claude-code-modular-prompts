# Swarm Execution: V31-V35 Quality Enforcement - Pre-Execution

| Swarm | Phase | Priority | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| V31-V35 | 7 - Quality Enforcement | HIGH | Starting |

## Parallel Execution Plan

### Agent V31: TDD Compliance Validator
**Mission**: Validate Test-Driven Development enforcement across framework
- Test RED→GREEN→REFACTOR cycle compliance
- Check test-first implementation
- Validate test coverage requirements
- Verify TDD module integration

### Agent V32: Test Coverage Auditor
**Mission**: Audit test coverage across all components
- Measure current coverage levels
- Identify gaps in test coverage
- Validate 90% threshold enforcement
- Check coverage tools integration

### Agent V33: Security Standards Validator
**Mission**: Validate security standards and threat modeling
- Check threat modeling requirements
- Validate security modules
- Test security gate enforcement
- Verify secure coding practices

### Agent V34: Performance Benchmark Tester
**Mission**: Test performance benchmarks and response times
- Validate 200ms p95 requirement
- Test performance monitoring
- Check optimization patterns
- Measure framework overhead

### Agent V35: Quality Gate Integration Tester
**Mission**: Test quality gate functionality and enforcement
- Validate gate blocking mechanisms
- Test integration points
- Check all quality dimensions
- Verify enforcement consistency

## Coordination Strategy
- **Independence**: Each agent tests different quality aspects
- **No conflicts**: Separate quality domains
- **Atomic commits**: Independent validation results
- **Integration**: Unified quality report after completion
