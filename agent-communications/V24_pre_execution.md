# Agent V24: Example Validator - Pre-Execution Report

**Mission**: Validate that all code examples in documentation are working and up-to-date.

**Timestamp**: 2025-07-13

## Starting Context

Building on previous agents:
- V21: Fixed many broken references across the framework
- V22: Ensured version consistency throughout documentation
- V23: Established canonical documentation sources and eliminated duplication

## Planned Approach

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Find all .md files in the repository
   - Extract code examples (marked with ```language blocks)
   - Categorize examples by type (Python, Shell, XML, etc.)

2. **Validation Phase**
   - Test Python code snippets for syntax errors
   - Validate shell command examples
   - Check that paths and references match current framework structure
   - Verify command usage matches current implementations

3. **Fix Phase**
   - Fix simple syntax errors
   - Update outdated paths and references
   - Mark complex broken examples for manual review
   - Add validation comments where appropriate

4. **Automation Phase**
   - Create example validation script for future use
   - Document validation procedures

## Focus Areas

- Command usage examples in documentation
- Module integration examples
- Configuration examples (PROJECT_CONFIG.xml)
- Script usage examples
- API usage patterns
- Framework workflow examples

## Success Criteria

- All executable code examples are syntactically correct
- Shell commands reference valid paths and tools
- Examples match current framework structure (v3.0.0)
- Broken examples are either fixed or clearly marked
- Validation script created for ongoing maintenance

## Pre-Operation Backup

Creating atomic commit before starting validation process.
