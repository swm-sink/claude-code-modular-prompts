# Agent Communications Hub

This directory contains communication logs from the 50-agent validation and enhancement process.

## Communication Protocol

Each agent MUST:

### Before Starting
Create `agent-vXX-start.md` with:
- Agent ID and mission
- Current timestamp
- Files/areas to be analyzed
- Dependencies on previous agents

### After Completion
Create `agent-vXX-complete.md` with:
- Summary of work completed
- Files modified (with specific changes)
- Issues discovered
- Decisions made
- Recommendations for future agents
- Any blockers or concerns

## Agent Status Tracking

| Agent | Status | Start Time | Complete Time | Key Findings |
|-------|--------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| V1 | Pending | - | - | Empty directory analysis |
| V2 | Pending | - | - | Command status investigation |
| V3 | Pending | - | - | Module path fixes |
| V4 | Pending | - | - | Pattern consolidation |
| V5 | Pending | - | - | Module census |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Important Notes

- Agents should read previous agent reports for context
- No agent should undo another agent's work without explicit justification
- All changes must be tracked for potential rollback
- Focus on user-friendliness while maintaining advanced functionality
