# 🎯 Prompt Engineering Action Plan
## From Over-Engineered Framework to Effective Claude Commands

**Date**: 2025-07-27  
**Reality Check**: This is about PROMPTS, not code  
**Timeline**: 4 weeks to usable prompt library

---

## 🔍 Current Reality

### What This Project Actually Is
- **Slash Commands**: Prompt templates for Claude conversations (e.g., `/task` → TDD guidance)
- **Components**: Reusable prompt fragments that compose together
- **Context Files**: Prompt engineering patterns and anti-patterns
- **NOT executable code** - These guide Claude's responses

### The Core Problem
We built a software architecture for what should be simple prompts. The complexity is hurting, not helping.

## 📋 4-Week Sprint to Useful Prompts

### Week 1: Test What We Have
**Goal**: Find out if any of this actually works

#### Day 1-2: Basic Testing
- [ ] Test `/help` in a Claude conversation
  - Does it list commands clearly?
  - How many tokens does it use?
  - Is the output helpful?

- [ ] Test `/task` for a simple feature
  - Does it guide TDD effectively?
  - Is the output actionable?
  - How complex is the response?

- [ ] Test `/auto` with various requests
  - Does it route correctly?
  - How smart is the routing?
  - What fails?

#### Day 3-4: Token Analysis
- [ ] Measure token usage for each command
- [ ] Identify which components bloat tokens
- [ ] Find redundant includes
- [ ] Document context window impact

#### Day 5: Reality Report
- [ ] Document what works/fails
- [ ] List token usage by command
- [ ] Identify showstopper issues
- [ ] Decide what to keep/cut

### Week 2: Radical Simplification
**Goal**: Make prompts that actually work

#### Simplify Top 5 Commands
1. **`/help`** → Clear, categorized command list
2. **`/task`** → Simple TDD workflow guide
3. **`/auto`** → Smart task routing
4. **`/query`** → Code analysis helper
5. **`/dev`** → Development workflow guide

#### Simplification Rules
- Remove ALL unnecessary XML
- Add concrete examples to EVERY command
- Max 500 tokens per base command
- Clear, direct language
- No abstract frameworks

#### Example Transformation
**Before** (Complex XML):
```xml
<command>
  <include>components/validation/validation-framework.md</include>
  <include>components/error-handling.md</include>
  <orchestration>
    <pattern>sequential-validation</pattern>
  </orchestration>
</command>
```

**After** (Simple Prompt):
```
You'll help create a new feature following TDD:
1. Write the test first
2. Run test (it should fail)
3. Write minimal code to pass
4. Refactor if needed

Example: Creating a user authentication feature...
[concrete example here]
```

### Week 3: Create Real Value
**Goal**: Show these prompts solve real problems

#### Create 5 Conversation Examples
1. **Feature Development** → `/task` → `/test` → `/dev`
2. **Bug Investigation** → `/query` → `/analyze` → `/fix`
3. **Code Review** → `/review` → `/suggest` → `/refactor`
4. **Learning Path** → `/help` → `/learn` → `/practice`
5. **Quick Tasks** → `/auto` handling various requests

#### Documentation Overhaul
- One-page quick start
- Command cheat sheet with examples
- Common workflows
- Troubleshooting guide
- NO technical implementation details

#### User Testing Prep
- Recruit 5 prompt engineers
- Create feedback form
- Set up Discord/Slack channel
- Plan daily check-ins

---

### Week 4: Beta Testing & Iteration
**Goal**: Real users successfully using prompts

#### Day 1-2: Beta Launch
- [ ] Onboard 5 beta testers
- [ ] Share simplified commands
- [ ] Provide example conversations
- [ ] Set up feedback channels

#### Day 3-5: Daily Iterations
- [ ] Collect conversation logs
- [ ] Identify confusion points
- [ ] Refine prompts based on usage
- [ ] Update examples

#### Day 6-7: Polish & Prepare
- [ ] Incorporate all feedback
- [ ] Finalize top 5 commands
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Plan expansion

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### Avoid These Traps
1. **Don't add more XML** - Simplify instead
2. **Don't theorize** - Test in real conversations
3. **Don't over-engineer** - Simple prompts work better
4. **Don't delay testing** - Test on Day 1
5. **Don't ignore feedback** - Users know best

### Remember
- These are PROMPTS, not software
- Complexity kills prompt effectiveness
- Examples > Explanations
- User success > Architectural elegance

---

## 🏁 Definition of Done

The project is ready when:
1. **5 commands work reliably** in Claude conversations
2. **Token usage is optimized** (<500 per command)
3. **Users succeed** 80% of the time
4. **Examples demonstrate value** clearly
5. **Beta users want more** commands

---

## 📊 Risk Mitigation

### If Commands Don't Work
- Scrap the XML framework entirely
- Write simple, direct prompts
- Focus on 3 commands instead of 5

### If Tokens Explode
- Remove all component includes
- Write self-contained prompts
- Use command chaining sparingly

### If Users Don't Adopt
- More examples
- Simpler commands
- Better onboarding
- Video demos

## 💡 The Real Goal

**Transform this from an over-engineered framework into a useful set of prompts that help people get work done with Claude.**

Simple > Complex  
Working > Perfect  
Useful > Clever
