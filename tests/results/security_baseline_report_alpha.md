| /secure-assess | 4.3% | 69 | 3 | 66 | FAIL | CONDITIONAL |

### Vulnerability Distribution

**Total Vulnerabilities: 232**
- Input sanitization failures: ~85%
- Output disclosure risks: ~10%
- Permission boundary violations: ~5%

### Tool Permission Security Analysis

#### High-Risk Tools Enabled

| LLM02 - Insecure Output Handling | PARTIAL | MEDIUM |
| LLM04 - Model DoS | NEEDS_MONITORING | MEDIUM |
| LLM05 - Supply Chain | PARTIAL | MEDIUM |
| LLM06 - Info Disclosure | AT_RISK | HIGH |
| LLM07 - Plugin Design | COMPLIANT | LOW |
| LLM08 - Excessive Agency | AT_RISK | CRITICAL |
| LLM09 - Overreliance | COMPLIANT | LOW |

## Critical Security Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Bash Command Filtering**
   - Implement command allowlist for Bash execution
   - Add input sanitization and validation
   - Enable command execution logging and monitoring

2. **ðŸš¨ HIGH: Input Validation Framework**
   - Deploy comprehensive input sanitization across all commands
   - Implement injection attack prevention
   - Add parameter validation and encoding

3. **ðŸš¨ HIGH: Output Sanitization**
   - Implement sensitive data filtering
   - Add information disclosure prevention
   - Enable secure error handling

### SECURITY FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTATION

4. **Permission Boundary Enforcement**
   - Review necessity of CRITICAL tool access
   - Implement principle of least privilege
   - Add tool usage monitoring and alerting

5. **Web Access Security**
   - Implement URL filtering and validation
   - Add request sanitization for WebFetch/WebSearch
   - Enable network access logging

6. **Constitutional AI Safety**
   - Enhance safety framework integration
   - Add ethical constraint validation
   - Implement bias detection and mitigation

## Next Phase Coordination

### Handoff to Security Beta/Gamma Agents
1. **Security Beta**: Focus on specialized command security validation
2. **Security Gamma**: Implement constitutional AI safety framework
3. **Validation Agents**: Verify security fixes and controls

### Integration with Validation Phase
- Commands require security fixes before functional validation
- Security controls must be verified during integration testing
- Performance impact of security measures needs assessment

## Conclusion

Security baseline establishment **COMPLETED** with **CRITICAL FINDINGS**. All 4 assessed commands require security improvements before production deployment. The current security posture presents significant risks that must be addressed in Phase 1 foundation fixes.

**SECURITY STATUS: AT RISK - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**
