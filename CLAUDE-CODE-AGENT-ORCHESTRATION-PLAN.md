# Claude Code Agent Orchestration Plan

## Overview
This plan integrates Claude Code's agent system to create a **Self-Building Context Engineering System** where specialized agents orchestrate the transformation process, use our scaffolding commands, and maintain the system.

## 🤖 10-Agent Architecture (Updated 2025-08-03)

### Core Coordination Agents (4)

#### 1. Transformation Orchestrator Agent
```yaml
---
name: transformation-orchestrator
description: Master agent that coordinates the entire transformation process
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, WebSearch
---

You are the Transformation Orchestrator for the Research-Driven Context Engineering System.

## Your Mission
Coordinate the 6-week transformation from template library to context engineering system.

## Context Loading
Load required context from:
- Master plan: `.claude/context/transformation-plan.md`
- Current phase: `.claude/memory/current-phase.md`
- Progress tracking: `.claude/memory/transformation-progress.md`

## Orchestration Workflow
1. Identify current transformation phase
2. Delegate tasks to specialized agents
3. Invoke scaffolding commands as needed
4. Track progress and update memory
5. Ensure quality standards are met

## Command Usage
Execute scaffolding commands:
- Phase -1: `/-1_context-foundation` through `/-1_context-memory`
- Phase 0-7: Follow numbered progression

## Delegation Pattern
For each phase:
1. Context setup → context-engineer agent
2. Research tasks → research-validator agent
3. Command creation → command-builder agent
4. Quality checks → quality-guardian agent
```

## 🔄 Agent Orchestration Workflow

### Phase-Based Orchestration

#### Phase -1: Context Foundation (Orchestrator delegates to Context Engineer)
```mermaid
graph LR
    O[Orchestrator] --> CE[Context Engineer]
    CE --> CF[/-1_context-foundation]
    CE --> CC[/-1_context-claude-code]
    CE --> CD[/-1_context-domains]
    CE --> MK[Memory Keeper]
```

#### Phase 1: Research (Orchestrator coordinates multiple agents)
```mermaid
graph LR
    O[Orchestrator] --> RV[Research Validator]
    RV --> WebSearch
    RV --> QG[Quality Guardian]
    QG --> MK[Memory Keeper]
    O --> CB[Command Builder]
    CB --> Commands[/1_research-*]
```

### Command Enhancement Pattern

All scaffolding commands will be enhanced to:

```yaml
# Command header enhancement
---
name: 1_research-framework
description: Research framework patterns with evidence
context-loading:
  - primary: .claude/context/research-protocols.md
  - domain: .claude/domains/technical/framework-patterns.md
  - memory: .claude/memory/research-history.md
agents:
  - research-validator: Source validation
  - quality-guardian: Anti-pattern prevention
  - memory-keeper: Decision tracking
---

# Command body enhancement
## Context Loading
Load required context for this phase:
$CONTEXT_LOADER$

## Agent Delegation
Delegate research to specialist:
@research-validator: Find framework best practices

## Memory Update
Track decisions:
@memory-keeper: Log framework choices
```

## 📝 CLAUDE.md Enhancement

Update master CLAUDE.md to include:

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Claude Code Configuration

## 🤖 Agent-Orchestrated Transformation System

This project uses specialized AI agents to orchestrate context engineering and transformation.

### Master Orchestration
**Lead Agent**: `.claude/agents/transformation-orchestrator.md`
- Coordinates 6-week transformation
- Delegates to specialist agents
- Tracks progress in memory system

### Specialist Agents (10-Agent Architecture)
**Core Coordination Agents (4):**
1. **Context Engineer**: `.claude/agents/context-engineer.md`
2. **Command Builder**: `.claude/agents/command-builder.md`
3. **Research Validator**: `.claude/agents/research-validator.md`

**Quality & Migration Agents (3):**
4. **Quality Guardian**: `.claude/agents/quality-guardian.md`
5. **Template Migration Specialist**: `.claude/agents/template-migration-specialist.md`
6. **Performance Optimizer**: `.claude/agents/performance-optimizer.md`

**User & Integration Agents (3):**
7. **User Experience Designer**: `.claude/agents/user-experience-designer.md`
8. **Framework Integrator**: `.claude/agents/framework-integrator.md`
9. **Documentation Orchestrator**: `.claude/agents/documentation-orchestrator.md`

### Agent Invocation
```bash
# Start transformation with orchestrator
@transformation-orchestrator: Begin Phase -1 context engineering

# Direct specialist invocation
@context-engineer: Set up domain structures
@research-validator: Validate React patterns
```

## 🧭 Context-Aware Navigation

All commands and agents load context from:
- **Master Context**: `.claude/context/`
- **Domain Specific**: `.claude/domains/*/`
- **Working Examples**: `.claude/examples/*/`
- **Project Memory**: `.claude/memory/`
```

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Week 1 Enhancement: Agent Creation
**NEW Day 1 Task**: Create 10-agent orchestration system
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents
# Create all 10 agent files with proper YAML frontmatter
# Core Coordination Agents (4): transformation-orchestrator, context-engineer, command-builder, research-validator
# Quality & Migration Agents (3): quality-guardian, template-migration-specialist, performance-optimizer  
# User & Integration Agents (3): user-experience-designer, framework-integrator, documentation-orchestrator
```

### Command Creation Pattern
When creating commands, agents will:
1. **Orchestrator** identifies command needed
2. **Command Builder** creates from template
3. **Research Validator** adds evidence requirements
4. **Quality Guardian** validates anti-patterns
5. **Context Engineer** ensures proper context loading
6. **Memory Keeper** tracks the creation

### Self-Building System
The agents work together to:
- Build the transformation commands
- Validate quality at each step
- Track all decisions
- Learn from the process
- Maintain the system post-transformation

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Agent Effectiveness
- Commands created follow all patterns: 100%
- Anti-patterns prevented: 95%+
- Evidence validated: 100%
- Context properly loaded: 100%
- Memory tracking complete: 100%

### Orchestration Success
- Transformation stays on schedule
- Quality standards maintained
- No manual coordination needed
- Self-documenting process
- Continuous improvement active

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Agent Communication Pattern
Agents communicate through:
1. **Shared Context**: `.claude/context/` files
2. **Memory System**: `.claude/memory/` tracking
3. **Command Invocation**: Using @ notation
4. **File Updates**: Coordinated changes

### Context Loading Mechanism
Commands will include:
```yaml
context-loading:
  primary: [main context file]
  secondary: [supporting contexts]
  memory: [relevant memory files]
```

This gets processed by agents to load appropriate context.

## 📊 Benefits of Agent Orchestration

1. **Automation**: Agents handle coordination
2. **Quality**: Multiple validation layers
3. **Consistency**: Patterns enforced automatically
4. **Learning**: System improves over time
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents
6. **Maintenance**: Self-maintaining system

This agent orchestration system transforms our static plan into a living, self-building system that creates itself while maintaining quality standards.
