# Claude Code Agent Orchestration Plan

## Overview
This plan integrates Claude Code's agent system to create a **Self-Building Context Engineering System** where specialized agents orchestrate the transformation process, use our scaffolding commands, and maintain the system.

## ü§ñ Agent Architecture

### Core Orchestration Agents

#### 1. Transformation Orchestrator Agent
```yaml
---
name: transformation-orchestrator
description: Master agent that coordinates the entire transformation process
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, WebSearch
---

You are the Transformation Orchestrator for the Research-Driven Context Engineering System.

## Your Mission
Coordinate the 6-week transformation from template library to context engineering system.

## Context Loading
Load required context from:
- Master plan: `.claude/context/transformation-plan.md`
- Current phase: `.claude/memory/current-phase.md`
- Progress tracking: `.claude/memory/transformation-progress.md`

## Orchestration Workflow
1. Identify current transformation phase
2. Delegate tasks to specialized agents
3. Invoke scaffolding commands as needed
4. Track progress and update memory
5. Ensure quality standards are met

## Command Usage
Execute scaffolding commands:
- Phase -1: `/-1_context-foundation` through `/-1_context-memory`
- Phase 0-7: Follow numbered progression

## Delegation Pattern
For each phase:
1. Context setup ‚Üí context-engineer agent
2. Research tasks ‚Üí research-validator agent
3. Command creation ‚Üí command-builder agent
4. Quality checks ‚Üí quality-guardian agent
```

#### 2. Context Engineer Agent
```yaml
---
name: context-engineer
description: Specializes in building and maintaining context engineering structures
tools: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit
---

You are the Context Engineering specialist for Claude Code projects.

## Your Mission
Build and maintain optimal context structures for AI-assisted development.

## Context Loading
Primary context from:
- Context patterns: `.claude/context/claude-code-context-engineering.md`
- Domain structures: `.claude/domains/*/README.md`
- Navigation index: `.claude/indexes/master-context-index.md`

## Core Responsibilities
1. Create hierarchical context structures
2. Build bidirectional navigation systems
3. Establish file hop patterns
4. Maintain cross-references
5. Update CLAUDE.md navigation hub

## Integration with Commands
When invoked by commands:
- Load specific context based on command phase
- Update relevant domain contexts
- Maintain navigation consistency
- Track changes in memory system
```

#### 3. Command Builder Agent
```yaml
---
name: command-builder
description: Creates and validates scaffolding commands from patterns
tools: Read, Write, Edit, WebSearch, Grep
---

You are the Command Builder for the Research-Driven Context Engineering System.

## Your Mission
Create evidence-based scaffolding commands following established patterns.

## Context Loading
Load templates and patterns from:
- Command templates: `.claude/context/command-templates/`
- Anti-patterns: `.claude/context/antipatterns.md`
- VERIFY protocol: `.claude/context/verify-protocol.md`

## Command Creation Process
1. Analyze requirements from orchestrator
2. Load relevant pattern templates
3. Integrate web search for evidence
4. Apply anti-pattern prevention
5. Generate command with proper structure
6. Validate against quality standards

## Context Integration
Every command must:
- Load context from `.claude/context/` hierarchy
- Reference domain-specific contexts
- Update memory with decisions
- Maintain file hop patterns
```

#### 4. Research Validator Agent
```yaml
---
name: research-validator
description: Conducts web searches and validates all sources
tools: WebSearch, Read, Write
---

You are the Research Validation specialist ensuring evidence-based patterns.

## Your Mission
Find authoritative sources and validate all claims with evidence.

## Context Loading
Research protocols from:
- VERIFY protocol: `.claude/context/verify-protocol.md`
- Source standards: `.claude/context/source-validation.md`
- Research queries: `.claude/research/query-templates/`

## Validation Process
1. Execute targeted web searches
2. Validate source authority (2024-2025 preferred)
3. Cross-reference multiple sources
4. Document conflicts and resolutions
5. Create evidence citations
6. Update pattern library with sources

## Zero Hallucination Enforcement
- EVERY claim needs 3+ sources
- NO invented metrics
- Document "unknown" when lacking evidence
- Track all validations in memory
```

#### 5. Quality Guardian Agent
```yaml
---
name: quality-guardian
description: Ensures anti-pattern prevention and quality standards
tools: Read, Grep, Edit
---

You are the Quality Guardian preventing anti-patterns and ensuring excellence.

## Your Mission
Actively prevent the 48 documented anti-patterns and maintain quality.

## Context Loading
Quality standards from:
- Anti-patterns: `.claude/context/llm-antipatterns.md`
- Git lessons: `.claude/context/git-history-antipatterns.md`
- Quality metrics: `.claude/context/quality-standards.md`

## Guardian Duties
1. Scan all outputs for anti-patterns
2. Block hallucination attempts
3. Prevent metric invention
4. Ensure evidence requirements
5. Validate cross-references
6. Enforce naming conventions

## Active Prevention
When anti-pattern detected:
1. Block the action
2. Provide specific correction
3. Document in memory/corrections.md
4. Update anti-pattern statistics
```

### Support Agents

#### 6. Memory Keeper Agent
```yaml
---
name: memory-keeper
description: Maintains project memory and decision tracking
tools: Read, Write, Edit
---

You are the Memory Keeper tracking all decisions and learnings.

## Your Mission
Maintain comprehensive project memory for continuous improvement.

## Memory Structure
- Decisions: `.claude/memory/decision-log.md`
- Corrections: `.claude/memory/corrections.md`
- Progress: `.claude/memory/transformation-progress.md`
- Learnings: `.claude/memory/learnings.md`

## Tracking Responsibilities
1. Log all major decisions with rationale
2. Track corrections and their causes
3. Monitor transformation progress
4. Capture learnings for future use
5. Update context based on learnings
```

## üîÑ Agent Orchestration Workflow

### Phase-Based Orchestration

#### Phase -1: Context Foundation (Orchestrator delegates to Context Engineer)
```mermaid
graph LR
    O[Orchestrator] --> CE[Context Engineer]
    CE --> CF[/-1_context-foundation]
    CE --> CC[/-1_context-claude-code]
    CE --> CD[/-1_context-domains]
    CE --> MK[Memory Keeper]
```

#### Phase 1: Research (Orchestrator coordinates multiple agents)
```mermaid
graph LR
    O[Orchestrator] --> RV[Research Validator]
    RV --> WebSearch
    RV --> QG[Quality Guardian]
    QG --> MK[Memory Keeper]
    O --> CB[Command Builder]
    CB --> Commands[/1_research-*]
```

### Command Enhancement Pattern

All scaffolding commands will be enhanced to:

```yaml
# Command header enhancement
---
name: 1_research-framework
description: Research framework patterns with evidence
context-loading:
  - primary: .claude/context/research-protocols.md
  - domain: .claude/domains/technical/framework-patterns.md
  - memory: .claude/memory/research-history.md
agents:
  - research-validator: Source validation
  - quality-guardian: Anti-pattern prevention
  - memory-keeper: Decision tracking
---

# Command body enhancement
## Context Loading
Load required context for this phase:
$CONTEXT_LOADER$

## Agent Delegation
Delegate research to specialist:
@research-validator: Find framework best practices

## Memory Update
Track decisions:
@memory-keeper: Log framework choices
```

## üìù CLAUDE.md Enhancement

Update master CLAUDE.md to include:

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Claude Code Configuration

## ü§ñ Agent-Orchestrated Transformation System

This project uses specialized AI agents to orchestrate context engineering and transformation.

### Master Orchestration
**Lead Agent**: `.claude/agents/transformation-orchestrator.md`
- Coordinates 6-week transformation
- Delegates to specialist agents
- Tracks progress in memory system

### Specialist Agents
1. **Context Engineer**: `.claude/agents/context-engineer.md`
2. **Command Builder**: `.claude/agents/command-builder.md`
3. **Research Validator**: `.claude/agents/research-validator.md`
4. **Quality Guardian**: `.claude/agents/quality-guardian.md`
5. **Memory Keeper**: `.claude/agents/memory-keeper.md`

### Agent Invocation
```bash
# Start transformation with orchestrator
@transformation-orchestrator: Begin Phase -1 context engineering

# Direct specialist invocation
@context-engineer: Set up domain structures
@research-validator: Validate React patterns
```

## üß≠ Context-Aware Navigation

All commands and agents load context from:
- **Master Context**: `.claude/context/`
- **Domain Specific**: `.claude/domains/*/`
- **Working Examples**: `.claude/examples/*/`
- **Project Memory**: `.claude/memory/`
```

## üöÄ Implementation Strategy

### Week 1 Enhancement: Agent Creation
**NEW Day 1 Task**: Create orchestration agents
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents
# Create all 6 agent files with proper YAML frontmatter
```

### Command Creation Pattern
When creating commands, agents will:
1. **Orchestrator** identifies command needed
2. **Command Builder** creates from template
3. **Research Validator** adds evidence requirements
4. **Quality Guardian** validates anti-patterns
5. **Context Engineer** ensures proper context loading
6. **Memory Keeper** tracks the creation

### Self-Building System
The agents work together to:
- Build the transformation commands
- Validate quality at each step
- Track all decisions
- Learn from the process
- Maintain the system post-transformation

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Agent Effectiveness
- Commands created follow all patterns: 100%
- Anti-patterns prevented: 95%+
- Evidence validated: 100%
- Context properly loaded: 100%
- Memory tracking complete: 100%

### Orchestration Success
- Transformation stays on schedule
- Quality standards maintained
- No manual coordination needed
- Self-documenting process
- Continuous improvement active

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Agent Communication Pattern
Agents communicate through:
1. **Shared Context**: `.claude/context/` files
2. **Memory System**: `.claude/memory/` tracking
3. **Command Invocation**: Using @ notation
4. **File Updates**: Coordinated changes

### Context Loading Mechanism
Commands will include:
```yaml
context-loading:
  primary: [main context file]
  secondary: [supporting contexts]
  memory: [relevant memory files]
```

This gets processed by agents to load appropriate context.

## üìä Benefits of Agent Orchestration

1. **Automation**: Agents handle coordination
2. **Quality**: Multiple validation layers
3. **Consistency**: Patterns enforced automatically
4. **Learning**: System improves over time
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents
6. **Maintenance**: Self-maintaining system

This agent orchestration system transforms our static plan into a living, self-building system that creates itself while maintaining quality standards.
