# Claude Code Context Engineering System - Complete Transformation Plan

## Project Transformation Overview

**From**: Claude Context Architect Template Library (88 commands + 96 components)  
**To**: Research-Driven Context Engineering System (35 scaffolding commands + verified patterns)

**Core Innovation**: Every piece of context must be research-verified through web search or come from vetted internal sources. No trust in LLM-generated content.

**Critical Additions**: 
1. Claude Code Context Engineering Foundation (Phase -1) establishes optimal context structure
2. AI Agent Orchestration System coordinates the transformation process automatically

## Two-Stage Transformation Strategy

### Stage 1: Transform THIS Project (Weeks 1-6)
Transform the existing Claude Context Architect from a template library into a context engineering framework using transformation-specific agents and commands.

### Stage 2: Function as Git Submodule (Post-transformation)
The transformed system serves as a reusable context engineering framework for OTHER projects via git submodule integration.

**Key Architecture Decision**: Clear separation between transformation tools (Stage 1 only) and framework tools (Stage 2 submodule).

## Command Mode Detection System

All commands must detect their execution context and operate accordingly:

```yaml
---
name: analyze-project
context-loading:
  transformation-mode:
    primary: /.transformation/context/current-state-analysis.md
    scope: ${PROJECT_ROOT}
    agents:
      - migration-specialist
  
  framework-mode:
    primary: ${FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/context/templates/analysis-protocol.md
    scope: ${PARENT_PROJECT_ROOT}
    agents:
      - pattern-extractor
---

# Detect execution mode
if [ -f ".transformation/active" ]; then
  MODE="transformation"
  WORKING_DIR="."
else
  MODE="framework"
  WORKING_DIR="../.."
fi

# Load appropriate context
$CONTEXT_LOADER$ --mode $MODE
```

This ensures commands work correctly whether transforming THIS project or operating as a submodule in OTHER projects.
