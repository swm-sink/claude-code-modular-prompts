# Project State Verification Checklist
*Last Verified: 2025-01-09*
*Last Update: Integration of frontend commands with backend logic*

## 🎯 Current Vision
**30-60 minute deep discovery consultation that generates project-specific commands**

## 📊 Actual State vs Claimed State

### Phase Status Verification

| Phase | Claimed | Structure | Integration | Functionality | ACTUAL |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| 1. Foundation | ✅ Complete | ✅ Dirs exist | ✅ INTEGRATED | ⚠️ Ready to test | 75% |
| 2. Research | ✅ Complete | ✅ Files exist | ✅ WIRED | ⚠️ Ready for testing | 65% |
| 3. Consultation | ✅ Complete | ✅ YAMLs exist | ⚠️ Some refs | ❌ No interactive flow | 40% |
| 4. Context | ✅ Complete | ✅ Templates exist | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ No generation | 40% |
| 5. Agents | ✅ Complete | ✅ Specs exist | ❌ No implementation | ❌ No agents work | 25% |
| 6. Commands | 🔄 In Progress | ✅ Integration done | ✅ INTEGRATED | ⚠️ Ready for testing | 70% |
| 7. Integration | 🔄 ACTIVE | ✅ Core done | ✅ Validated | ⚠️ More needed | 40% |
| 8. Validation | ❌ Not started | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | 0% |

**Overall ACTUAL Progress: ~48% (Structure exists, CORE INTEGRATION COMPLETE, functionality ready for testing)**

**Major Milestone Achieved**: Frontend-backend integration validated at 100%

## 🔍 Critical Gaps (UPDATED)

### ✅ Gap 1: Commands Don't Use Backend [RESOLVED]
- `/discover-project` - NOW INTEGRATED with `.claude-architect/research/`
- `/generate-commands` - NOW INTEGRATED with `.claude-architect/command-forge/`
- `/deep-discovery` - NOW ORCHESTRATES integrated commands
- Integration validated: 100% pass rate on validation script

### Gap 2: Backend Has No Execution
- YAML configs describe flows but don't run
- Templates exist but aren't used
- Patterns defined but not applied

### Gap 3: No End-to-End Feature Works
- Can't actually do 30-60 minute consultation
- Can't generate project-specific commands
- Can't create working context from discovery

## ✅ What Actually Works (UPDATED 2025-01-09 - Session 2)
- Basic command structure exists (36 commands)
- Some commands can analyze files
- Directory structure is well-organized
- **Frontend-backend integration complete for core commands**
- `/discover-project` integrated with research backend
- `/generate-commands` integrated with command-forge backend
- `/deep-discovery` orchestrates integrated commands
- Integration validation script (100% pass rate)
- **NEW: Root directory cleaned (94→7 files)**
- **NEW: README fixed with actual commands**
- **NEW: `/welcome` command for user onboarding**
- **NEW: `/list-commands` for command discovery**
- **NEW: Archive structure organized**

## ❌ What Doesn't Work
- Deep discovery consultation flow
- Command generation from patterns
- Agent-based analysis
- Context generation from discovery

## 🎯 Next Priority: Make ONE Thing Work End-to-End

**Recommendation**: Focus on making `/discover-project` → `/generate-commands` actually work:
1. Wire `/discover-project` to use backend analysis
2. Make it actually create PROJECT-DNA.md with real discoveries
3. Wire `/generate-commands` to use command-forge templates
4. Test that it generates at least one working command

## 📝 Verification Commands

```bash
# Run these to verify actual state:

# 1. Check if deep discovery works
/deep-discovery start
# Expected: Should start consultation
# Actual: ?

# 2. Check if project discovery works
/discover-project
# Expected: Creates PROJECT-DNA.md
# Actual: ?

# 3. Check if command generation works
/generate-commands
# Expected: Creates custom commands
# Actual: ?

# 4. Count working features
ls .claude/commands/generated/
# Expected: Generated commands
# Actual: ?
```

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

1. Updating claude.todos.yaml without testing functionality
2. Creating more YAML configs instead of wiring existing ones
3. Building new architectures instead of integrating existing
4. Claiming "complete" when only structure exists
5. Starting Phase 7 before Phase 6 actually works

## 📅 Daily Verification Protocol

At start of each session:
1. Run verification commands above
2. Update this file with actual results
3. Choose ONE gap to address
4. Test it works before moving on
5. Update status based on functionality, not files
