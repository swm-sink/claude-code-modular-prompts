# Current State Baseline - Pre-Simplification
*Date: 2025-01-09*
*Purpose: Document actual working state before changes*

## Verified Working Components

### Commands That Function
1. `/welcome-simple` - Provides orientation
2. `/discover-project-simple` - Analyzes projects, creates PROJECT-DNA.md
3. `/generate-commands-simple` - Generates custom commands

### Scripts That Work
1. `setup.sh` - Installation script
2. `validate.sh` - System health check
3. `cleanup.sh` - Maintenance tasks
4. `test-harness.sh` - Basic testing
5. `emergency-reset.sh` - Recovery tool

### Context That Affects Behavior
1. Anti-pattern documentation (48+ patterns)
2. Claude Code technical constraints
3. Behavioral protocols (confusion, validation)
4. Session state understanding

## Known Issues

### Integration Problems
- Frontend commands don't use backend YAMLs
- Backend analyzes external repos, not user projects
- Session persistence not fully implemented

### Documentation Conflicts
- Multiple conflicting status reports
- README claims 102 commands, only 3-6 work
- Various completion percentages claimed

## Metrics

### Current State
- Files: 1,771
- Directories: 305
- Size: 20MB
- Working Commands: 3-6
- Anti-patterns: 48+
- Backend YAMLs: 84
- Documentation Files: 379

### Dependencies
- 5 files in .claude reference .claude-architect
- Minimal actual integration
- Most commands are self-contained

## Test Results
*To be completed after testing phase*

## Risk Assessment
- High risk of losing valuable context
- Medium risk of breaking working commands
- Low risk if proper backups maintained
