## Quick Progress Check Commands

```bash
# Count transformed commands
grep -r "Standard DRY Components" commands/ | wc -l

# Find untransformed commands
find commands -name "*.md" -exec grep -L "Standard DRY Components" {} \; | grep -v README

# Validate all XML
python3 /tmp/dry_validation_framework.py

# Check component usage
grep -r "<include>" commands/ | cut -d: -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

## Recovery Points
- Validation framework: `/tmp/dry_validation_framework.py`
- Mass transform script: `/tmp/mass_dry_transform.py`
- Component inventory: 58 components in `components/`
- Commands inventory: 146 commands in `commands/`

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Complete testing commands transformation (5 files)
2. Complete remaining development commands (6 files)
3. Start security commands transformation (5 files)
