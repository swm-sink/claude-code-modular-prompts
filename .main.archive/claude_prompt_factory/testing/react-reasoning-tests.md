## FUNCTIONAL TEST CASES

### Test Case 1: Database Performance Crisis
**Scenario:** Production database queries suddenly 10x slower, affecting all users

**Input:**
```
/reason-react "Our production database performance crashed overnight. Query times went from 100ms to 1000ms average. 50,000 active users affected. Need immediate diagnosis and fix. Database is PostgreSQL 14, main table has 50M records, no recent code changes."
```

**Expected ReAct Process:**
```
Iteration 1:
  Thought: Critical production issue, need systematic diagnosis
  Action: Check database metrics and recent system changes
  Observation: Query execution plans show missing critical index

Iteration 2:  
  Thought: Index corruption or removal likely cause
  Action: Investigate index status and recent maintenance
  Observation: Index rebuild needed due to corruption

Iteration 3:
  Thought: Need immediate fix with minimal downtime
  Action: Plan index rebuild during low-traffic window
  Observation: Solution ready for implementation
```

**ACTUAL TEST EXECUTION:**
```xml
<test_execution>
  <problem>Database performance crisis - 10x slowdown affecting 50k users</problem>
  <claude_response>
    <iteration_1>
      <thought>
        Critical production issue requiring immediate systematic diagnosis.
        Factors: Sudden onset (overnight), significant impact (10x slowdown), large user base (50k affected).
        No recent code changes suggests infrastructure or database-level issue.
        Priority: Fast diagnosis → immediate fix → long-term prevention.
      </thought>
      <action>
        Diagnose database performance issue systematically:
        1. Check query execution plans for recent slow queries
        2. Analyze database metrics: CPU, memory, I/O, lock contention
        3. Review database logs for errors or warnings since yesterday
        4. Examine index status and statistics
      </action>
      <observation>
        Key finding: Query execution plans show sequential scans where index scans expected.
        EXPLAIN ANALYZE reveals missing index on primary lookup column (user_id).
        Database logs show index corruption errors starting 6 hours ago.
        Autovacuum process failed to complete, leaving corrupted index.
      </observation>
    </iteration_1>
    
    <iteration_2>
      <thought>
        Root cause identified: Index corruption on critical user_id column.
        Need immediate fix with minimal downtime impact.
        Options: 1) Rebuild index, 2) Create new index concurrently, 3) Emergency read replica.
        Concurrent rebuild safest for production.
      </thought>
      <action>
        Plan index recovery strategy:
        1. Create new index concurrently (no downtime): CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_user_id_new ON main_table(user_id)
        2. Monitor creation progress and performance impact
        3. Once complete, drop old corrupted index and rename new one
        4. Update query optimizer statistics
      </action>
      <observation>
        Solution designed: Concurrent index rebuild will restore performance.
        Estimated time: 45-60 minutes for 50M records.
        Performance should improve gradually as index builds.
        No downtime required, minimal performance impact during rebuild.
      </observation>
    </iteration_2>
    
    <iteration_3>
      <thought>
        Immediate fix planned. Need monitoring and prevention strategy.
        Should also prepare communication for users and stakeholders.
      </thought>
      <action>
        Complete response plan:
        IMMEDIATE (next 10 minutes):
        - Start concurrent index rebuild
        - Monitor database performance metrics
        - Communicate status to users via status page
        
        SHORT-TERM (next 2 hours):
        - Complete index rebuild and performance restoration
        - Validate full system performance recovery
        
        PREVENTION (this week):
        - Fix autovacuum configuration to prevent future corruption
        - Implement database health monitoring alerts
        - Review index maintenance procedures
      </action>

### Test Case 2: Architecture Decision Under Constraints
**Scenario:** Choose technology stack for new microservice with specific constraints

**Input:**
```
/reason-react "We're building a new real-time notification service that needs to handle 1M notifications/day, integrate with 5 different systems, be maintainable by our 3-person backend team (Python/Java expertise), deploy on AWS, and be ready in 8 weeks. Need technology stack recommendation."
```

**ACTUAL TEST EXECUTION:**
```xml
<test_execution>
  <problem>Technology stack selection for real-time notification service</problem>

### Test Case 3: Creative Problem-Solving
**Scenario:** Design user onboarding for complex B2B software

**Input:**
```
/reason-react "Our B2B analytics platform has 73% user drop-off during onboarding. Current onboarding is 45 minutes of tutorials and setup. Users say it's overwhelming. Need to redesign onboarding to be engaging, educational, and get users to their first 'aha moment' quickly. Platform has 50+ features across 6 main modules."
```

**ACTUAL TEST EXECUTION:**
```xml
<test_execution>
  <problem>Redesign B2B analytics platform onboarding to reduce 73% drop-off rate</problem>
  <claude_response>
    <iteration_1>
      <thought>
        High-stakes UX problem with clear metrics:
        - 73% drop-off is critical business issue
        - 45-minute onboarding is clearly too long
        - Users feel overwhelmed (cognitive overload)
        - Need to identify core "aha moment" and shortest path to value
        - Complex platform (50+ features, 6 modules) needs simplified introduction
      </thought>
      <action>
        Analyze current onboarding problems and user psychology:
        1. Identify what creates "aha moments" in analytics platforms
        2. Map user journey from signup to first valuable insight
        3. Research successful B2B onboarding patterns
        4. Define minimal viable onboarding (MVB) that delivers value
      </action>
      <observation>
        Key insights:
        - "Aha moment" in analytics = seeing personal/relevant data produce actionable insight
        - Current onboarding front-loads learning vs. value delivery
        - Successful B2B onboarding focuses on one core workflow first
        - Users need to feel competent and see immediate relevance
        - 45 minutes violates attention span and motivation curves
      </observation>
    </iteration_1>
    
    <iteration_2>
      <thought>
        Need to flip the approach: start with value delivery, not feature education.
        Should identify the single most impactful user workflow and optimize path to that.
        Also need progressive disclosure instead of overwhelming feature dump.
      </thought>
      <action>
        Design value-first onboarding strategy:
        
        CORE PRINCIPLE: "Value in 5 minutes, competence in 15 minutes"
        
        NEW ONBOARDING FLOW:
        1. Data Connection (2 min): Connect one primary data source
        2. Instant Insight (3 min): Auto-generate relevant dashboard with user's data
        3. Guided Exploration (10 min): Interactive tutorial on improving the insights
        4. Customization (optional): User-driven feature discovery based on interest
        
        PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE:
        - Show 3-5 most relevant features based on user's industry/role
        - Hide advanced features until user demonstrates basic competency
        - Use contextual help instead of upfront tutorials
      </action>
      <observation>
        Promising new approach identified:
        - Reduces time to first value from 45 min to 5 min
        - Addresses cognitive overload through progressive disclosure
        - Personalizes experience based on user data and context
        - Maintains education but makes it optional and contextual
        - Creates early success experience to build confidence
      </observation>
