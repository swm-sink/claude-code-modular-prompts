    **Recommended Multi-Tenant Database Strategy**
    
    **Hybrid Approach with Tier-Based Architecture:**
    
    **Tier 1 (Startup/Small)**: Schema-based isolation in shared PostgreSQL
    - Up to 1,000 tenants per database cluster
    - Cost-effective with good isolation
    - Automated schema management and migration tools
    
    **Tier 2 (Growth/Medium)**: Dedicated database clusters  
    - 10-50 tenants per cluster based on usage
    - Better performance and compliance
    - Shared operational overhead across similar-sized tenants
    
    **Tier 3 (Enterprise)**: Dedicated infrastructure
    - Single tenant per cluster with custom configuration
    - Maximum compliance and performance guarantees
    - Premium pricing with dedicated support
    
    **Implementation Strategy:**
    1. Start with schema-based approach for MVP
    2. Build automatic tenant migration tools
    3. Implement tier promotion based on usage/revenue
    4. Develop comprehensive monitoring and alerting
    
    **Expected Outcomes:**
    - 70% cost reduction vs individual databases
    - Enterprise-grade compliance capabilities
    - Seamless scaling from startup to enterprise
    - Operational simplicity with automated management

      <complete_oauth_implementation>
        **Full OAuth 2.0 Authentication System**
        
        **1. Authorization Server Integration:**
        ```javascript
        // OAuth Provider Configuration
        const oauthConfig = {
          authorizationURL: 'https://provider.com/oauth/authorize',
          tokenURL: 'https://provider.com/oauth/token',
          clientID: process.env.OAUTH_CLIENT_ID,
          clientSecret: process.env.OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET,
          redirectURI: 'https://yourapp.com/oauth/callback'
        };
        ```
        
        **2. Authorization Code Flow:**
        ```javascript
        // Initiate OAuth flow
        app.get('/auth/login', (req, res) => {
          const authURL = `${oauthConfig.authorizationURL}?` +
            `response_type=code&` +
            `client_id=${oauthConfig.clientID}&` +
            `redirect_uri=${oauthConfig.redirectURI}&` +
            `scope=read write&` +
            `state=${generateSecureState()}`;
          
          res.redirect(authURL);
        });
        
        // Handle OAuth callback
        app.get('/oauth/callback', async (req, res) => {
          const { code, state } = req.query;
          
          // Exchange code for tokens
          const tokenResponse = await exchangeCodeForTokens(code);
          
          // Store tokens securely
          await storeUserTokens(tokenResponse);
          
          res.redirect('/dashboard');
        });
        ```
        
        **3. Token Management:**
        ```javascript
        // Automatic token refresh
        const refreshTokenIfNeeded = async (userId) => {
          const tokens = await getUserTokens(userId);
          
          if (isTokenExpiring(tokens.access_token)) {
            const newTokens = await refreshAccessToken(tokens.refresh_token);
            await updateUserTokens(userId, newTokens);
            return newTokens.access_token;
          }
          
          return tokens.access_token;
        };
        ```
        
        **4. Scope-Based Authorization:**
        ```javascript
        // Middleware for scope validation
        const requireScope = (requiredScope) => {
          return (req, res, next) => {
            const userScopes = req.user.scope.split(' ');
            
            if (userScopes.includes(requiredScope)) {
              next();
            } else {
              res.status(403).json({ 
                error: 'Insufficient scope',
                required: requiredScope,
                provided: userScopes
              });
            }
          };
        };
        
        // Usage
        app.get('/api/admin', validateOAuthToken, requireScope('admin'), (req, res) => {
          // Admin-only functionality
        });
        ```
        
        **Key Adaptations from JWT Experience:**
        ✅ **Stateless validation** → **Provider introspection**
        ✅ **Local token signing** → **External provider integration**
        ✅ **Simple refresh** → **OAuth refresh token flow**
        ✅ **Role-based access** → **Scope-based authorization**
        
        **Implementation Timeline:**
        - Day 1-2: Provider integration and basic flow
        - Day 3-4: Token management and refresh logic
        - Day 5-6: Scope-based authorization and testing

## 🔧 **Best Practices and Tips**

### **Session Management Best Practices**
1. **Start with clear goals**: Use descriptive session names and types
2. **Save frequently**: Preserve progress with `session-save --analytics true`
3. **Review analytics**: Learn from productivity insights and recommendations
4. **Use compression wisely**: `intelligent` compression balances size and preservation

### **Reasoning Optimization**
1. **Choose the right tool**: ReAct for systematic problems, Tree of Thoughts for complex decisions
2. **Provide context**: More context leads to better reasoning and outcomes
3. **Validate results**: Cross-check recommendations with domain expertise
4. **Iterate and improve**: Use meta-learning to enhance future problem-solving

### **Multi-Agent Coordination**
1. **Select appropriate agents**: Match agent types to problem domains
2. **Use collaborative style**: Best for comprehensive solutions requiring consensus
3. **Provide clear objectives**: Specific goals lead to better agent coordination
4. **Leverage diverse perspectives**: Multiple viewpoints improve solution quality

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Session Not Loading Properly**
**Problem**: Session context incomplete or missing
**Solution**: 
```
/session-load "session-name" --mode review
# Review session status and re-create if necessary
/session-create "session-name-recovered" --type original_type
```

### **Command Execution Slow**
**Problem**: Commands taking longer than expected
**Solution**:
- Check system load and available resources
- Use simpler problem decomposition
- Consider using `fast` mode for meta-learning
- Break complex problems into smaller parts

### **Constitutional AI Concerns**
**Problem**: Safety warnings or limitations
**Solution**:
- Review and clarify your request
- Provide additional context for safety assessment
- Consider alternative approaches suggested by the framework
- Consult documentation for best practices
