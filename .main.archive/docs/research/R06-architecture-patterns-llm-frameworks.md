# Research Agent R06: Architecture Patterns for LLM Frameworks
**Research Focus**: 2025 architectural patterns for AI code generation frameworks, focusing on modular design, @ import systems, and hierarchical documentation structures from the Claude Code community.

## Executive Summary

2025 LLM framework architecture has evolved toward highly modular, hierarchical systems with sophisticated import mechanisms and context-aware design patterns. The Claude Code ecosystem demonstrates advanced architectural patterns that emphasize separation of concerns, dynamic loading, and intelligent documentation hierarchies.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Modular Framework Architecture

**Component Isolation and Reusability**
- Frameworks simplify customizing and deploying LLMs through modular middleware that standardizes inputs and outputs
- Single-task fine-tuning allows using an army of smaller models that each specialize on their own tasks
- System modularization into individual models for tasks like content moderation, extraction, and summarization
- Each component designed independently for flexibility and reusability

**Hierarchical Component Organization**
- LLM agents framework combines modular components that allow for reasoning, planning, memory, and interaction
- Structural and functional blueprint that governs how LLM agents are designed, deployed, and integrated
- Clear separation between orchestration layer and execution modules

### 2. @ Import Systems and Context Loading

**Dynamic Import Architecture**
- @ import syntax for hierarchical document loading and context assembly
- Enables modular context by importing other files directly using @path/to/import syntax
- Keeps main memory files clean while allowing for modular context composition
- Supports chained imports with dependency resolution

**Context Assembly Engine**
- Automatic inclusion of relevant documentation when commands execute
- Hierarchical loading with dependency injection patterns
- Dynamic context window optimization through selective loading
- Import system with standardized interface contracts

### 3. Hierarchical Documentation Structures

**Three-Tier Documentation Architecture**
```
Foundation Level: CLAUDE.md (master context)
├── Component Level: @docs/component-name.md
└── Feature Level: @feature/specific-implementation.md
```

**Knowledge Graph Navigation**
- Claude Code performs best with clear, logical hierarchies that it can easily parse
- Main README.md serves as central hub with clear links to specialized documentation files
- Creates a knowledge graph that Claude can navigate efficiently
- Hierarchical organization minimizes maintenance while maximizing AI effectiveness

### 4. Agentic Architecture Patterns

**Multi-Agent Orchestration**
- Planning Phase: Main agent coordinates overall strategy
- Execution Phase: Sub-agents handle specialized tasks in parallel
- Validation Phase: Independent verification agents check outputs
- Integration Phase: Results consolidate under main agent coordination

**Sub-Agent System Design**
- Sophisticated sub-agent system enabling parallel task execution
- Specialized problem-solving through domain-specific agents
- Claude automatically spawns sub-agents working on different aspects simultaneously
- Coordinated delegation with clear interface contracts

## Framework Design Principles

### 1. Context-Aware Architecture

**Intelligent Context Management**
- Claude Code ingests and indexes code, developing internal representation of codebase architecture
- Works on codebase as a whole through comprehensive understanding
- Context window optimization with selective loading strategies
- Dynamic context assembly based on command requirements

**Architectural Understanding**
- Transforms Claude from beginner to junior developer who writes indistinguishable code
- Generates REST endpoints, service layers, and repositories that integrate perfectly
- Works when projects follow established patterns and conventions

### 2. Modular Composition Patterns

**Interface Standardization**
- Open standards and leveraging open-source libraries with interoperable APIs
- Standardized inputs and outputs across modular components
- Clear contracts between framework layers
- Version-aware component integration

**Composable Architecture**
- Combining encoder-decoder models for structured tasks
- Causal decoders for content creation
- Tailored, efficient LLM configurations across industries
- Flexible component design adapting to various use cases

### 3. Performance and Scalability

**Resource Optimization**
- Balancing model size and complexity with hardware resources for efficiency
- Parallelism (model and data) ensuring scalability
- Lazy loading and hierarchical context management
- Token-efficient architecture patterns

**Scalable Design Patterns**
- Modular design allows flexibility across different use cases
- Hardware-aware architecture optimization
- Distributed processing capabilities
- Efficient context window utilization

## Implementation Strategies
