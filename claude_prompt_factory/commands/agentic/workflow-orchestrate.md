### 2. **Adaptive Strategy Development**
Applies ReAct reasoning to develop execution strategy:
- **Strategy Exploration**: Consider multiple execution approaches
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies
- **Optimization Planning**: Plan for continuous improvement throughout execution
- **Coordination Design**: Design agent coordination patterns

### 3. **Meta-Learning Optimization**
Uses meta-learning to optimize workflow execution:
- **Experience Integration**: Apply lessons from similar workflows
- **Rapid Adaptation**: Quickly adapt to new requirements or constraints
- **Performance Prediction**: Predict optimal execution parameters
- **Learning Strategy**: Establish learning loops for continuous improvement

### 4. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
Coordinates specialized agents for parallel execution:
- **Agent Specialization**: Assign specialized roles based on workflow needs
