# /monitor alerts - Alert Management Command

## Purpose
Comprehensive alert management system for configuring, tuning, and tracking alerts across infrastructure, applications, and business metrics.

## Usage
```bash
/monitor alerts [action] [scope] [--level=critical|high|medium|low] [--mode=create|update|silence]
```

## Core Alert Management

### ðŸš¨ Alert Configuration
- **Threshold rules**: CPU, memory, disk, network capacity limits
- **Performance alerts**: Response time, error rate, throughput degradation
- **Business metrics**: SLA violations, conversion rate drops, revenue impact
- **Security alerts**: Failed logins, suspicious activity, policy violations

### ðŸ“Š Alert Rules Engine
- **Dynamic thresholds**: ML-based anomaly detection and adaptive baselines
- **Composite conditions**: Multi-metric correlation and dependency logic
- **Time-based rules**: Business hours vs. off-hours alert sensitivity
- **Escalation policies**: Notification hierarchy and timeout handling

### ðŸ”§ Alert Tuning
- **Noise reduction**: Flapping detection, duplicate suppression, smart grouping
- **Sensitivity adjustment**: False positive reduction, alert fatigue prevention
- **Correlation analysis**: Root cause identification, related alert grouping
- **Feedback loops**: Alert effectiveness scoring, auto-tuning based on resolution

### ðŸ“± Notification Management
- **Multi-channel delivery**: Email, SMS, Slack, PagerDuty, webhook integration
- **Escalation ladders**: Primary â†’ Secondary â†’ Manager notification chains
- **Acknowledgment tracking**: Response times, resolution status, follow-up actions
- **Alert history**: Pattern analysis, recurring issue identification, trend reporting

## Alert Lifecycle
- **Detection** (automated monitoring and threshold evaluation)
- **Notification** (immediate stakeholder alerting via configured channels)
- **Acknowledgment** (incident ownership and response initiation)
- **Investigation** (root cause analysis and impact assessment)
- **Resolution** (problem remediation and service restoration)
- **Post-mortem** (lessons learned and prevention strategy updates)

## Integration Points
- Monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog, New Relic)
- Incident management (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, VictorOps)
- Communication platforms (Slack, Teams, Discord webhooks)
- ITSM tools (ServiceNow, Jira Service Desk, Zendesk)
