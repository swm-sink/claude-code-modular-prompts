# /think deep - Advanced Deep Thinking Framework

Sophisticated deep thinking system with comprehensive analysis, systematic reasoning, and breakthrough problem-solving methodologies.

## Usage
```bash
/think deep analyze                          # Deep analytical thinking
/think deep --systematic                     # Systematic reasoning approach
/think deep --breakthrough                   # Breakthrough thinking methodology
/think deep --comprehensive                  # Comprehensive deep analysis
```

## Workflow

The `/think deep` command follows a systematic process for deep analysis.

```xml
<deep_think_workflow>
  <step name="Activate Thinking Mode & Decompose Problem">
    <description>Activate the appropriate thinking mode (e.g., 'extended' for a deep dive, 'ultra' for maximum depth) and decompose the complex problem into smaller, more manageable facets.</description>
    <tool_usage>
      <tool>AI Analysis</tool>
      <description>Use an advanced AI model to break down the problem.</description>
    </tool_usage>
  </step>
  
  <step name="Explore Solutions & Consider Implications">
    <description>Explore multiple potential solution paths, considering the pros and cons, edge cases, and long-term implications of each approach. This may involve running parallel analyses to compare different strategies.</description>
    <tool_usage>
      <tool>AI Simulation/Analysis</tool>
      <description>Leverage AI to simulate and analyze different solution paths.</description>
    </tool_usage>
  </step>
  
  <step name="Synthesize Insights & Provide Recommendations">
    <description>Synthesize the insights from the analysis into a comprehensive, structured recommendation. The output includes a detailed explanation of the recommended approach, confidence scores, and a clear, actionable implementation plan.</description>
    <output>A detailed deep analysis report.</output>
  </step>
</deep_think_workflow>
```

## Configuration

The `/think deep` command can be configured through the `PROJECT_CONFIG.xml` file.

```xml
<command name="/think deep">
  <setting name="default_thinking_mode" value="extended" description="The default thinking mode to use." />
  <setting name="include_confidence_scores" value="true" description="Whether to include confidence scores in the analysis." />
</command>
```

## Use Cases

*   **Architectural Decisions**: Analyze complex architectural trade-offs to make informed decisions.
*   **Complex Debugging**: Investigate and diagnose challenging bugs and performance issues.
*   **Strategic Planning**: Explore the long-term implications of different technical strategies.
