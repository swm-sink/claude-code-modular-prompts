# /ai refactor - Advanced AI Refactoring

Sophisticated AI refactoring system with intelligent optimization, pattern recognition, and automated quality improvements.

## Usage
```bash
/ai refactor optimize                        # Performance optimization refactoring
/ai refactor --patterns                      # Pattern-based refactoring
/ai refactor --architecture                  # Architectural improvements
/ai refactor --intelligent                   # AI-driven intelligent refactoring
```

## Options
- `--focus`: performance, readability, structure, patterns
- `--type`: function, class, module, package
- `--preserve-api`: Maintain public interface compatibility
- `--test-driven`: Run tests after each refactoring step
- `--interactive`: Confirm each suggested change
- `--depth`: shallow, medium, deep analysis

## Safety Features
- Automated backup before changes
- Test execution validation
- API compatibility checking
- Rollback on failure
- Change impact analysis

## Output
- Refactoring plan with priority ranking
- Before/after code comparisons
- Performance impact predictions
- Test coverage preservation report
- Documentation updates

## Integration
- Works with existing test suites
- Integrates with version control
- Supports multiple programming languages
- Compatible with CI/CD pipelines

**Quality Focus**: Systematic improvement without functionality loss
