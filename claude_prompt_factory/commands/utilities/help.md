    ## **🔧 Session Loading Troubleshooting Guide**
    
    ### **Step 1: Immediate Diagnostics** (2 minutes)
    
    **Check Session Status:**
    ```
    /session-list --filter "project-name" --details true
    ```
    **Look for:**
    - ✅ Session completion status (should be "saved" not "interrupted")
    - ✅ Context compression ratio (should be 85-95%, not >98%)
    - ✅ Git integration status (should show commit hash)
    - ✅ File integrity markers (no corruption indicators)
    
    **Verify Context Availability:**
    ```
    /session-load "session-name" --mode review
    ```
    **Expected Behavior:**
    - Shows session summary without full restoration
    - Displays available context elements
    - Identifies missing or corrupted sections
    
    ### **Step 2: Recovery Strategies** (5-10 minutes)
    
    #### **Strategy A: Partial Recovery** (Recommended First)
    ```
    /session-load "session-name" --mode partial --recover critical
    ```
    **What this does:**
    - Loads verified context elements only
    - Preserves key insights and decisions
    - Allows continuation with reduced but functional context
    
    #### **Strategy B: Git-Based Recovery**
    ```
    /session-create "session-name-recovered" --type recovery --git_ref "previous-commit-hash"
    ```
    **What this does:**
    - Creates new session from git history
    - Reconstructs context from commit messages and changes
    - Provides clean starting point with historical context
    
    #### **Strategy C: Session Reconstruction**
    ```
    /session-create "session-name-rebuilt" --type continuation
    /help "session reconstruction" --previous_session "failed-session-details"
    ```
    **What this does:**
    - Guides you through manual context reconstruction
    - Helps identify and preserve critical information
    - Sets up new session with maximum recovered context
    
    ### **Step 3: Prevention Measures** (Configure Once)
    
    **Optimize Compression Settings:**
    ```
    /session-save --compress intelligent --backup true --validation comprehensive
    ```
    **Recommended Settings:**
    - `intelligent`: Balances compression with information preservation
    - `backup true`: Creates redundant copies for recovery
    - `validation comprehensive`: Verifies context integrity before save
    
    **Enable Advanced Recovery:**
    ```
    /session-create --recovery_mode enhanced --git_integration comprehensive
    ```
    **Benefits:**
    - Automatic incremental saves every 10 minutes
    - Git commit integration with detailed context markers
    - Multi-layer backup with different compression levels

  <preventive_recommendations>
    ## **🛡️ Prevention and Best Practices**
    
    ### **Robust Session Management**
    1. **Regular Incremental Saves**: Save every 15-20 minutes during active work
    2. **Compression Validation**: Always use `intelligent` compression with validation
    3. **Git Integration**: Ensure comprehensive git commit integration
    4. **Backup Strategy**: Enable automatic backup with multiple compression levels
    
    ### **Context Quality Assurance**
    1. **Critical Information Tagging**: Mark essential context for preservation priority
    2. **Decision Point Documentation**: Explicitly save key reasoning and decisions
    3. **Cross-Session Linking**: Link related sessions for context inference
    4. **Regular Context Audits**: Periodically verify context integrity and completeness
    
    ### **Performance Optimization**
    1. **Memory Management**: Monitor and optimize memory usage during sessions
    2. **Progressive Loading**: Use staged context loading for large sessions
    3. **Context Pruning**: Remove obsolete context while preserving critical insights
    4. **System Resource Monitoring**: Track system performance during session operations
