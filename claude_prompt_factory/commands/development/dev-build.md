# Dev Build Command

## Overview
The `/dev build` command provides comprehensive build automation for development workflows, supporting multiple build targets with incremental builds and clear progress reporting.

## Usage
```bash
/dev build [target] [--clean] [--watch] [--verbose]
```

## Build Targets
- **all** - Complete project build (default)
- **frontend** - Frontend assets and components
- **backend** - Server-side application
- **tests** - Test suite compilation
- **docs** - Documentation generation
- **docker** - Container image builds

## Build Features
1. **Incremental Builds**
   - Dependency tracking and change detection
   - Only rebuild modified components
   - Cache optimization for faster builds

2. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Real-time build progress display
   - Step-by-step execution status
   - Time estimation and completion percentage

3. **Error Handling**
   - Clear error messages with context
   - Build failure analysis and suggestions
   - Automatic retry for transient failures

4. **Build Validation**
   - Pre-build dependency checks
   - Post-build verification tests
   - Output artifact validation

## Execution Process
The build command executes through Bash tool with parallel processing where possible, monitoring build output and providing structured feedback.

## Example Usage
```bash
/dev build all --clean
/dev build frontend --watch
/dev build tests --verbose
```

## Output Format
- Build progress with completion percentage
- Component-wise build status
- Error details with resolution suggestions
- Build time metrics and performance data
