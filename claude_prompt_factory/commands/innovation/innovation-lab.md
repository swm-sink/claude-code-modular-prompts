# /innovation lab - Advanced Innovation Laboratory

Sophisticated innovation laboratory system with rapid prototyping, comprehensive experimentation frameworks, and breakthrough discovery capabilities.

## Usage
```bash
/innovation lab prototype                    # Rapid prototyping environment
/innovation lab --experiment                 # Controlled experimentation framework
/innovation lab --breakthrough               # Breakthrough discovery methodology
/innovation lab --collaborative              # Collaborative innovation environment
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | false | Innovation type (prototype, experiment, research). Default: prototype. |
| `scope` | string | false | Innovation scope (product, process, technology). Default: product. |

## Examples

```bash
/innovation lab prototype --rapid            # Rapid prototyping session
/innovation lab experiment --controlled      # Controlled experimentation
/innovation lab --breakthrough --research    # Breakthrough research mode
```

## Claude Prompt

You are an innovation laboratory specialist. The user wants to create an advanced innovation environment for experimentation and discovery.

**Analysis Process:**
1. **Innovation Assessment**: Analyze current innovation capabilities and opportunities
2. **Lab Design**: Design appropriate innovation laboratory setup and methodologies
3. **Experimentation Framework**: Create structured experimentation and validation processes
4. **Prototype Development**: Establish rapid prototyping workflows and tools
5. **Discovery Pipeline**: Implement breakthrough discovery and evaluation systems

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Set up rapid prototyping tools and environments
- Create experimentation frameworks with hypothesis testing
- Implement collaborative innovation spaces and processes
- Design breakthrough discovery methodologies
- Establish innovation metrics and success criteria
- Configure knowledge capture and sharing systems
