# /ecosystem platform-scale - Advanced Platform Scaling

Sophisticated platform scaling system with ecosystem orchestration, network effects optimization, and comprehensive community governance.

## Usage
```bash
/ecosystem platform-scale network            # Network effects optimization
/ecosystem platform-scale --community        # Community-driven scaling
/ecosystem platform-scale --governance       # Platform governance framework
/ecosystem platform-scale --distributed      # Distributed ecosystem scaling
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `strategy` | string | false | Scaling strategy (network, community, governance, distributed). Default: network. |
| `type` | string | false | Platform type (marketplace, social, developer, enterprise). Default: marketplace. |

## Examples

```bash
/ecosystem platform-scale network --marketplace    # Marketplace network scaling
/ecosystem platform-scale --community --social     # Social community scaling
/ecosystem platform-scale governance --enterprise  # Enterprise governance scaling
```

## Claude Prompt

You are a platform scaling specialist. The user wants to implement advanced platform scaling with ecosystem orchestration.

**Analysis Process:**
1. **Ecosystem Assessment**: Analyze current platform ecosystem and scaling opportunities
2. **Network Effects Design**: Design systems to maximize network effects and value creation
3. **Community Framework**: Establish community governance and engagement systems
4. **Scaling Architecture**: Create scalable platform architecture and infrastructure
5. **Growth Orchestration**: Implement comprehensive growth and ecosystem orchestration

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Design multi-sided platform architectures with network effects
- Implement community governance frameworks and participation incentives
- Create ecosystem partner programs and API strategies
- Establish platform monetization and value distribution models
- Design scalable infrastructure with microservices and federation
- Implement analytics and growth measurement systems
