# ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Examples - Multi-Command Workflow Mastery

Welcome to intermediate framework usage! This section focuses on **multi-command workflows** - the core skill for solving complex development problems systematically.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Master

Master the art of **chaining commands** to solve real-world development challenges:
- âœ… **Research â†’ Fix â†’ Deploy** workflows for complex bugs
- âœ… **Analysis â†’ Refactor â†’ Validate** workflows for architectural improvements  
- âœ… **Plan â†’ Implement â†’ Monitor** workflows for feature development
- âœ… **Strategic thinking** about when and how to combine commands

## ðŸ”¥ Core Workflow Patterns

### Multi-Command Workflows
**Time**: 2-3 hours to master all patterns  
**Files**: [multi-command-workflows/](multi-command-workflows/)

**The Essential Patterns:**
- [feature-development.md](multi-command-workflows/feature-development.md) - **Complete feature lifecycle** (query â†’ feature â†’ protocol)
- [bug-investigation.md](multi-command-workflows/bug-investigation.md) - **Systematic debugging** (query â†’ task â†’ protocol)  
- [refactoring-workflow.md](multi-command-workflows/refactoring-workflow.md) - **Architectural improvements** (query â†’ feature â†’ protocol)

**Why These Matter:**
- **Solve 80% of real development scenarios**
- **Teach systematic thinking** about complex problems
- **Reusable patterns** across languages and projects
- **Proven workflows** that consistently deliver results

## ðŸ“š Prerequisites

### Required Experience
- Completed [beginner examples](../01-beginner/) 
- 1+ weeks regular framework usage
- Comfortable with basic commands (`/auto`, `/task`, `/query`)
- Understanding of TDD workflow and quality gates

### Development Skills Needed
- Experience with multi-file projects
- Basic understanding of software architecture
- Familiarity with testing concepts
- Experience with Git and collaboration

## ðŸš€ Ready to Start?

**Quick Assessment:**
- [ ] Can use basic framework commands confidently
- [ ] Understand when to use `/query` vs `/task` vs `/auto`
- [ ] Have worked on real development projects
- [ ] Ready to learn systematic problem-solving approaches

## âœ… Success Criteria

You've mastered intermediate workflow patterns when you can:
- [ ] **Chain commands strategically** for complex development problems
- [ ] **Choose the right workflow** based on problem type and scope
- [ ] **Solve bugs systematically** using the research â†’ fix â†’ validate pattern
- [ ] **Plan refactoring effectively** using the analysis â†’ improve â†’ deploy pattern
- [ ] **Mentor others** in multi-command workflow patterns

## ðŸŽ“ Workflow Pattern Mastery

Track your progress through the three core patterns:

### Pattern 1: Bug Investigation Workflow  
- [ ] Used `/query` to systematically analyze complex bugs
- [ ] Applied `/task` with TDD to implement targeted fixes
- [ ] Used `/protocol` to safely deploy bug fixes with monitoring
- [ ] **Mastery**: Can debug any complex issue systematically

### Pattern 2: Feature Development Workflow
- [ ] Used `/query` to understand requirements and existing systems
- [ ] Applied `/feature` for comprehensive PRD-driven development  
- [ ] Used `/protocol` for production-ready feature deployment
- [ ] **Mastery**: Can deliver complete features with quality

### Pattern 3: Refactoring Workflow
- [ ] Used `/query` to analyze architectural problems and opportunities
- [ ] Applied `/feature` to systematically improve code architecture
- [ ] Used `/protocol` to safely deploy architectural changes
- [ ] **Mastery**: Can improve legacy systems without breaking them

## ðŸ”§ Core Skills You'll Develop

### Strategic Thinking
- **Problem Analysis**: Break complex problems into systematic approaches
- **Command Selection**: Choose the right command sequence for each situation
- **Quality Focus**: Build validation and testing into every workflow
- **Production Mindset**: Think about deployment and monitoring from the start

### Workflow Patterns
- **Research First**: Always understand before implementing (`/query` â†’ action)
- **Systematic Execution**: Follow proven patterns for predictable results
- **Validation Always**: Use `/protocol` for production-ready deployment
- **Iterative Improvement**: Learn from each workflow to improve future approaches

## ðŸ’¡ Workflow Best Practices

### The Golden Rules
1. **Start with `/query`** - Understand the problem completely before acting
2. **Follow TDD** - Write tests first, implement minimally, refactor safely
3. **Think Production** - Every change should be deployment-ready
4. **Validate Everything** - Use `/protocol` for critical deployments

### When to Use Each Pattern
- **Bug Investigation**: For complex, production issues requiring systematic debugging
- **Feature Development**: For complete new functionality with requirements and architecture
- **Refactoring**: For improving existing code architecture and maintainability

## ðŸ›Ÿ Getting Help

### When Workflows Aren't Working
- **Study the examples** - Each workflow example shows complete problem â†’ solution flows
- **Start simpler** - If a 3-command workflow is too complex, try 2-command first  
- **Practice the patterns** - Use the exact command sequences from examples
- **Focus on one pattern** - Master one workflow before moving to the next

### Common Issues
- **Forgetting `/query`** - Always research and understand before implementing
- **Skipping `/protocol`** - Don't deploy critical changes without validation
- **Wrong command choice** - Reference "When to Use Each Pattern" section above

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Strategy

### Start Here
1. **Read all three workflow examples** to understand the patterns
2. **Pick one workflow** that matches a problem you're currently facing
3. **Follow the exact command sequence** from the example
4. **Adapt the pattern** to your specific situation

### Practice Approach
- **Use on real problems** - Don't just read, apply to actual development work
- **Follow the patterns exactly** - Don't improvise until you've mastered the basics
- **Share with team** - Teach others the patterns as you learn them

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

After mastering these workflow patterns:

1. **Apply regularly** - Use multi-command workflows for all complex problems
2. **Develop intuition** - Learn to quickly identify which pattern fits each situation
3. **Mentor others** - Share workflow patterns with team members
4. **Advance to expert level** - Explore [advanced examples](../03-advanced/) for cutting-edge patterns
