# Refactoring Workflow Example

## Overview
This example demonstrates the **query ‚Üí feature ‚Üí protocol** workflow for systematic, large-scale refactoring with architectural improvements.

## The Problem Scenario
Your e-commerce application has grown organically over 2 years. The checkout process is becoming difficult to maintain:
- 800+ line checkout view function
- Business logic mixed with presentation logic
- No clear separation of concerns
- Adding new payment methods requires touching multiple files
- Testing is difficult due to tight coupling

Time for strategic refactoring to improve maintainability and enable future growth.

## The Multi-Command Workflow

### Step 1: Analysis and Understanding - `/query`
```bash
/query "analyze checkout system architecture and identify refactoring opportunities for better maintainability"
```

**What the Framework Does:**
- Maps current checkout system architecture
- Identifies code smells and coupling issues
- Analyzes dependencies and data flow
- Evaluates testing gaps and pain points
- Recommends architectural improvements

**Expected Framework Output:**
```
üèóÔ∏è CHECKOUT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS:

Current Structure:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ views/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ checkout.py (847 lines) - MONOLITHIC ‚ö†Ô∏è
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ order.py - Order, OrderItem models
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ payment.py - Payment, Transaction models
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ customer.py - Customer, Address models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ forms/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ checkout_forms.py - 12 different forms
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ checkout/ - 8 template files

Code Smell Analysis:
üö® CRITICAL ISSUES:
- checkout_view() function: 847 lines (recommended: <50)
- 15 different responsibilities in single function
- Direct database queries mixed with business logic
- Payment processing logic embedded in view
- No error recovery or transaction rollback
- Hard to test due to monolithic structure

üîç COUPLING ANALYSIS:
checkout.py dependencies:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models (5 different models directly imported)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ payment_processors (3 different gateways)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inventory_service (stock checking)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email_service (order confirmations)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tax_calculator (complex tax logic)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shipping_calculator (shipping cost logic)

üìä COMPLEXITY METRICS:
- Cyclomatic complexity: 47 (recommended: <10)
- Lines of code: 847 (recommended: <100 per function)
- Number of parameters: 23 (recommended: <5)
- Nested levels: 8 (recommended: <4)

üß™ TESTING CHALLENGES:
- Current test coverage: 23% (recommended: >90%)
- Integration tests only (no unit tests possible)
- Mock setup requires 15+ external dependencies
- Test execution time: 45 seconds per test

üí° REFACTORING OPPORTUNITIES:

1. EXTRACT SERVICES:
   - PaymentProcessor service
   - InventoryService  
   - TaxCalculationService
   - ShippingService
   - OrderCreationService

2. IMPLEMENT PATTERNS:
   - Command pattern for checkout steps
   - Strategy pattern for payment methods
   - Factory pattern for service creation
   - Observer pattern for order events

3. IMPROVE ARCHITECTURE:
   - Separate business logic from presentation
   - Implement proper error handling and rollback
   - Add comprehensive validation
   - Create testable, modular components

üéØ RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
Strangler Fig pattern - gradually replace monolithic checkout with 
modular services while maintaining existing functionality.
```

### Step 2: Systematic Refactoring Implementation - `/feature`
```bash
/feature "refactor checkout system into modular services with proper separation of concerns and comprehensive testing"
```

**What the Framework Does:**
- Creates Product Requirements Document for refactoring
- Designs new modular architecture
- Implements services using TDD approach
- Maintains backward compatibility during transition
- Creates comprehensive test suite for all components

**Generated PRD for Refactoring:**
```
üìã CHECKOUT SYSTEM REFACTORING PRD

## Executive Summary
Transform monolithic checkout system into modular, testable, maintainable 
architecture while preserving all existing functionality and improving performance.

## Technical Requirements

### Service Architecture:
1. **CheckoutOrchestrator** - Coordinates checkout process
2. **PaymentProcessorService** - Handles all payment operations
3. **InventoryService** - Manages stock checking and reservation
4. **TaxCalculationService** - Centralizes tax logic
5. **ShippingService** - Handles shipping calculations
6. **OrderService** - Manages order creation and lifecycle
7. **NotificationService** - Handles email/SMS notifications

### Quality Requirements:
- Test coverage: >95% for all services
- Performance: <200ms response time for checkout
- Backward compatibility: 100% API compatibility
- Error handling: Comprehensive with rollback capability
- Documentation: Full API documentation for all services

### Implementation Strategy:
- Phase 1: Extract and test core services
- Phase 2: Implement new checkout orchestrator
- Phase 3: Migrate existing checkout to use services
- Phase 4: Remove legacy code after validation
```

### Step 3: Production Deployment and Validation - `/protocol`
```bash
/protocol "deploy refactored checkout system with comprehensive monitoring and rollback capability"
```

**What the Framework Does:**
- Validates all tests pass with >95% coverage
- Performs A/B testing between old and new checkout
- Sets up comprehensive monitoring for performance metrics
- Creates automated rollback triggers
- Validates production deployment safety

**Framework Validation Output:**

## Key Learning Points

### ‚úÖ Refactoring Workflow Benefits
1. **Strategic Analysis**: `query` identifies architectural problems and opportunities
2. **Systematic Implementation**: `feature` creates comprehensive solution with PRD
3. **Safe Deployment**: `protocol` ensures production readiness with monitoring

### üìö Architectural Improvements Achieved
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic separated from presentation
- **Testability**: 97% test coverage vs previous 23%
- **Performance**: 82% improvement in response time
- **Maintainability**: Modular services vs monolithic function
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new payment methods and features

### üîç When to Use This Workflow
- ‚úÖ Large-scale architectural improvements
- ‚úÖ Legacy code modernization
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization projects
- ‚úÖ Maintainability improvements
- ‚úÖ Adding testability to existing systems

### üöÄ Pattern Applications
- **Monolith Decomposition**: Breaking large functions/classes
- **Service Extraction**: Creating modular services
- **Design Pattern Implementation**: Strategy, Factory, Command patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Database query optimization, caching

## Variations for Different Refactoring Types

### Database Schema Refactoring:
```bash
/query "analyze database schema for normalization and performance opportunities"
/feature "refactor database schema with migration strategy and data integrity"
/protocol "deploy schema changes with zero-downtime migration"
```

### API Refactoring:
```bash
/query "analyze API design for RESTful principles and performance issues"  
/feature "refactor API with backward compatibility and improved design"
/protocol "deploy API changes with versioning and client migration plan"
```

### Frontend Architecture Refactoring:
```bash
/query "analyze frontend architecture for component reusability and performance"
/feature "refactor frontend with modern patterns and component architecture" 
/protocol "deploy frontend changes with progressive enhancement strategy"
```
