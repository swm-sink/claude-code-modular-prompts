# Workflows - Common Pattern Mastery

> **Mission**: Master the powerful workflow patterns that professional developers use for real-world development challenges.

Having experienced immediate success in quick-start, you're ready to learn the sophisticated workflow patterns that make the Claude Code framework truly powerful. These examples demonstrate how professionals structure complex development work for maximum efficiency and quality.

## 🔄 Professional Development Workflows

Each workflow example teaches a specific pattern used in real development teams:

### 1. [Research → Plan → Implement](research-plan-implement/)
**The Foundation Pattern**: Query → Feature → Task coordination
**Perfect for**: New features, complex requirements, unfamiliar domains
**Time**: 15-30 minutes

```bash
cd research-plan-implement/
# Master the core development pattern used by all professionals
```

**What you'll master:**
- 🔍 **Research Phase**: Deep codebase analysis and requirement understanding
- 📋 **Planning Phase**: Architecture design and implementation strategy
- ⚡ **Implementation Phase**: Coordinated execution with quality gates
- 🔄 **Iteration Cycles**: Continuous refinement and improvement

---

### 2. [Multi-Agent Development](multi-agent-development/)
**The Coordination Pattern**: Parallel development with agent coordination
**Perfect for**: Large features, team coordination, complex systems
**Time**: 20-45 minutes

```bash
cd multi-agent-development/
# Learn sophisticated multi-agent coordination for complex projects
```

**What you'll master:**
- 🤝 **Agent Coordination**: Multiple specialized agents working together
- 🔀 **Parallel Development**: Simultaneous work on different components
- 🔗 **Integration Management**: Coordinating results from multiple agents
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into complex workflows

---

### 3. [Long-Running Session](long-running-session/)
**The Session Pattern**: Multi-day development with context preservation
**Perfect for**: Large features, learning projects, complex refactoring
**Time**: Hours to days (with breaks)

```bash
cd long-running-session/
# Master session management for extended development work
```

**What you'll master:**
- 💾 **Context Preservation**: Maintaining state across multiple sessions
- 📝 **Progress Tracking**: GitHub issue integration for complex workflows
- 🔄 **Session Resumption**: Picking up where you left off seamlessly
- 📊 **Milestone Management**: Breaking large work into manageable phases

---

### 4. [Code Review Workflow](code-review-workflow/)
**The Quality Pattern**: Systematic code review and improvement
**Perfect for**: Quality assurance, team standards, learning from code
**Time**: 10-20 minutes

```bash
cd code-review-workflow/
# Learn systematic approaches to code quality and review
```

**What you'll master:**
- 🔍 **Systematic Analysis**: Comprehensive code quality assessment
- 📊 **Quality Metrics**: Coverage, performance, and maintainability analysis
- 🚀 **Improvement Strategies**: Actionable recommendations for enhancement
- 👥 **Team Standards**: Consistent quality across development teams

---

### 5. [Team Collaboration](team-collaboration/)
**The Coordination Pattern**: Multi-developer framework usage
**Perfect for**: Team leads, shared projects, knowledge transfer
**Time**: 30-60 minutes

```bash
cd team-collaboration/
# Master team coordination and knowledge sharing workflows
```

**What you'll master:**
- 👥 **Multi-Developer Setup**: Framework configuration for teams
- 📚 **Knowledge Transfer**: Sharing patterns and best practices
- 🔄 **Workflow Standardization**: Consistent development approaches
- 📊 **Team Metrics**: Tracking team productivity and quality
