# ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Examples - Getting Started

Welcome to the Claude Code Framework! This section contains everything you need to get started, from installation to your first successful project.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

Master the framework basics in 2 simple steps:
- âœ… **Setup and basic usage** - Get the framework working
- âœ… **Core commands** - Master `/task`, `/query`, `/auto` for real development
- âœ… **Practical application** - Use framework for actual development tasks

## ðŸš€ Simple Learning Path

### Step 1: Setup and Installation
**Time**: 15-30 minutes  
**File**: [getting-started.md](getting-started.md)

**What you'll do**:
- Install the framework and verify it works
- Understand basic concepts and terminology
- Create your first PROJECT_CONFIG.xml
- Run your first successful command

### Step 2: Master Core Commands  
**Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Files**: [basic-commands/](basic-commands/)

**The essential commands**:
- [task-command.md](basic-commands/task-command.md) - **Single focused tasks** (most common)
- [query-command.md](basic-commands/query-command.md) - **Research and analysis** (before coding)  
- [auto-command.md](basic-commands/auto-command.md) - **Intelligent routing** (when unsure)

## âœ… Ready for Intermediate?

You're ready for [intermediate workflow patterns](../02-intermediate/) when you can:
- [ ] **Use basic commands confidently** - Execute `/task`, `/query`, `/auto` successfully
- [ ] **Configure projects** - Create working PROJECT_CONFIG.xml files  
- [ ] **Complete real tasks** - Use framework for actual development work

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

- **Framework not working?** Check [getting-started.md](getting-started.md) setup steps
- **Commands failing?** Use `/help` command for assistance
- **Still stuck?** Review the command examples - they show complete working flows

**Keep it simple!** Master these 3 commands first, then move to **workflow patterns** in intermediate examples. That's where the real power is!
