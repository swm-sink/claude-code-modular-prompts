# üü¢ Beginner Examples - Getting Started

Welcome to the Claude Code Framework! This section contains everything you need to get started, from installation to your first successful project.

## üìã What You'll Learn

By completing this section, you will:
- ‚úÖ Install and configure the framework correctly
- ‚úÖ Understand the 4 core commands (`/task`, `/query`, `/auto`, `/session`)
- ‚úÖ Create your first PROJECT_CONFIG.xml configuration
- ‚úÖ Complete a full development workflow
- ‚úÖ Troubleshoot common beginner issues

## üéØ Learning Path

### Step 1: Setup and Installation
**Time**: 15-30 minutes  
**Files**: [getting-started.md](getting-started.md)

Learn how to:
- Install the framework
- Verify your installation
- Understand the basic concepts
- Set up your first project

### Step 2: Basic Commands
**Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Files**: [basic-commands/](basic-commands/)

Master the fundamental commands:
- [task-command.md](basic-commands/task-command.md) - Single focused development tasks
- [query-command.md](basic-commands/query-command.md) - Code research and analysis  
- [auto-command.md](basic-commands/auto-command.md) - Intelligent task routing
- [session-command.md](basic-commands/session-command.md) - Extended work sessions

### Step 3: Your First Project
**Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Files**: [first-project/](first-project/)

Build confidence with:
- [setup-new-project.md](first-project/setup-new-project.md) - Project initialization
- [basic-configuration.md](first-project/basic-configuration.md) - Simple configuration
- [simple-workflow.md](first-project/simple-workflow.md) - End-to-end workflow

### Step 4: Troubleshooting
**Time**: As needed  
**Files**: [troubleshooting/](troubleshooting/)

Solve common issues:
- [installation-issues.md](troubleshooting/installation-issues.md) - Setup problems
- [configuration-errors.md](troubleshooting/configuration-errors.md) - Config issues
- [command-not-working.md](troubleshooting/command-not-working.md) - Command problems

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

If you're already familiar with similar tools and want to jump in:

1. **Install**: Follow your platform's installation guide
2. **Test**: Run `/auto "test my setup"` in any project directory
3. **Learn**: Try the [task-command.md](basic-commands/task-command.md) example
4. **Configure**: Create a basic PROJECT_CONFIG.xml

## üìö Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- Basic programming concepts (variables, functions, control flow)
- Command line basics (navigating directories, running commands)
- Text editor usage (for configuration files)

### Required Tools
- Claude Code framework installed
- Git (for project management)
- Text editor or IDE
- Terminal/command line access

### Programming Languages
Examples work with any language, but specific examples use:
- **Python** (most examples) - Good for beginners
- **JavaScript** - Popular and approachable
- **Go** - Simple and clear examples

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You're ready for [intermediate examples](../02-intermediate/) when you can:

- [ ] Successfully execute all 4 basic commands
- [ ] Create and modify PROJECT_CONFIG.xml files
- [ ] Complete a simple development task using `/task`
- [ ] Research existing code using `/query`
- [ ] Navigate and troubleshoot common issues
- [ ] Understand framework concepts and terminology

## üéì Completion Checklist

Mark these off as you complete each section:

### Installation and Setup
- [ ] Framework installed and working
- [ ] Completed getting-started guide
- [ ] Successfully ran test commands
- [ ] Environment properly configured

### Basic Commands Mastery
- [ ] Completed task-command example
- [ ] Completed query-command example  
- [ ] Completed auto-command example
- [ ] Completed session-command example
- [ ] Understand when to use each command

### First Project Success
- [ ] Set up a new project from scratch
- [ ] Created working PROJECT_CONFIG.xml
- [ ] Completed end-to-end development workflow
- [ ] Used multiple commands in sequence

### Troubleshooting Skills
- [ ] Identified and resolved setup issues
- [ ] Fixed configuration problems
- [ ] Debugged command execution issues
- [ ] Know where to find help and resources

## üõü Getting Help

### If You Get Stuck
1. **Check troubleshooting**: Look in [troubleshooting/](troubleshooting/) for your specific issue
2. **Review prerequisites**: Ensure you have all required tools and knowledge
3. **Start simple**: Begin with the most basic example that works
4. **Read error messages**: Framework provides detailed error information

### Common Beginner Mistakes
- ‚ùå **Skipping installation verification** - Always test your setup first
- ‚ùå **Complex first projects** - Start with simple, single-file examples
- ‚ùå **Ignoring configuration** - PROJECT_CONFIG.xml is essential for success
- ‚ùå **Not reading error messages** - Errors contain helpful guidance

### Support Resources
- **Built-in help**: Use `/help` for context-specific assistance
- **Examples**: Each example includes troubleshooting sections
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides in the main docs/
- **Community**: Framework community forums and discussions

## üéØ Learning Tips

### For Programming Beginners
- Start with Python examples (most beginner-friendly)
- Read each example completely before trying it
- Type commands manually (don't copy-paste) to build muscle memory
- Experiment with small variations to understand behavior

### For Experienced Developers
- Skim the getting-started guide to understand framework concepts
- Focus on command patterns and configuration structure
- Try examples in your preferred programming language
- Look for patterns that apply to your existing projects

### Best Practices
- **Start small** - Begin with simple examples and gradually increase complexity
- **Practice regularly** - Use the framework for real development tasks
- **Document learnings** - Keep notes on what works and what doesn't
- **Ask questions** - The community is helpful and welcoming

## üîÑ Next Steps

After completing the beginner examples:

1. **Practice** - Use the framework for real development tasks
2. **Explore** - Try different programming languages and project types
3. **Advance** - Move to [intermediate examples](../02-intermediate/) when ready
4. **Share** - Help other beginners and contribute to the community

Remember: Everyone learns at their own pace. Take your time and focus on understanding concepts rather than rushing through examples.
