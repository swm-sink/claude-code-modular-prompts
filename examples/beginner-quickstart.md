# Beginner Quick Start Example
*For users new to Claude Code context engineering systems*

## Scenario: JavaScript Developer, First Time Using Templates

### Step 1: Installation (5 minutes)
```bash
# Clone the context engineering system
git clone https://github.com/swm-sink/claude-context-architect
cd claude-context-architect

# Install templates into your project
./setup.sh ../my-react-app
cd ../my-react-app
```

### Step 2: Welcome & Orientation (5 minutes)
```
# In Claude Code conversation:
/welcome beginner
# Follow the beginner path guidance
```

### Step 3: Start Customization (10 minutes)
```
/adapt-to-project
# Answer the questions about your project:
# - Project Name: "My React App"
# - Tech Stack: "React, Node.js, MongoDB"
# - Domain: "web-dev"
# - Team Size: "1"
```

### Step 4: Focus on Essential Commands (30 minutes)
Instead of customizing all 88 commands, start with just 5:
- `/task` - For development tasks
- `/test` - For testing workflows
- `/analyze` - For code analysis
- `/review` - For code reviews
- `/help` - For getting help

### Step 5: Replace Placeholders (20 minutes)
```
/replace-placeholders
# In your editor, Find & Replace:
# [INSERT_PROJECT_NAME] → My React App
# [INSERT_TECH_STACK] → React, Node.js, MongoDB
# [INSERT_DOMAIN] → web-dev
```

### Step 6: Test Your First Command (5 minutes)
```
/task "add a user authentication component"
# Should work without placeholder errors
```

### Step 7: Validate (5 minutes)
```
/validate-adaptation
# Should show successful customization
```

## Total Time Investment: ~1.5 hours
## Result: 5 working, customized commands for your React project

## Next Steps After Success
- Gradually add more commands from quality or specialized categories
- Explore atomic components for custom command building
- Set up validation hooks for ongoing maintenance
