# Command Chaining - Sophisticated Workflow Orchestration

> **Advanced Pattern**: Master complex multi-command workflows with state management, parallel execution, and sophisticated error recovery.

Command chaining represents the pinnacle of framework workflow sophistication. It enables you to orchestrate complex development processes that span multiple commands, preserve context across operations, execute in parallel where possible, and recover gracefully from failures. This is the pattern that transforms the framework from a tool into a development orchestration platform.

## ⚡ Advanced Orchestration Capabilities

### Sequential Chaining
Commands execute in order, with each command building on the results of previous commands while preserving full context and state.

### Parallel Execution  
Independent commands execute simultaneously with coordination and result consolidation, maximizing efficiency and reducing total execution time.

### Conditional Routing
Dynamic workflow paths based on intermediate results, allowing adaptive responses to changing conditions and requirements.

### State Management
Comprehensive context preservation across complex workflows, maintaining understanding and decisions throughout multi-step processes.

### Error Recovery
Sophisticated error handling with rollback capabilities, alternative routing, and graceful degradation strategies.

## 🚀 Advanced Workflow Examples

### Prerequisites
- ✅ Mastered [workflows/](../../workflows/) patterns
- ✅ Comfortable with Research → Plan → Implement cycle
- ✅ Understanding of framework command selection and execution
- ✅ Experience with multi-command coordination

### Example 1: Full-Stack Feature Development (20 minutes)

```bash
# Copy advanced chaining configuration
cp /path/to/claude-code-modular-prompts/examples/advanced/command-chaining/PROJECT_CONFIG.xml .

# Complex sequential workflow with state preservation
/chain sequential --workflow="full-stack-feature" \
  --commands="/query,/feature,/swarm,/task,/docs,/protocol" \
  --target="user profile management system"
```

**Workflow Execution**:
1. **Research Phase** (`/query`): Comprehensive analysis of requirements, existing patterns, and integration points
2. **Architecture Phase** (`/feature`): Complete system design including frontend, backend, database, and API components  
3. **Parallel Development** (`/swarm`): Coordinated multi-agent implementation of different components
4. **Integration Phase** (`/task`): Component integration, testing, and quality validation
5. **Documentation Phase** (`/docs`): Comprehensive documentation generation
6. **Production Phase** (`/protocol`): Production readiness validation and deployment preparation

### Example 2: Performance Optimization Pipeline (15 minutes)

```bash
# Parallel execution with result coordination
/chain parallel --coordination="/swarm" \
  --workflows="analysis:(/query performance bottlenecks),optimization:(/task optimize critical paths),testing:(/task implement performance tests)" \
  --consolidation="/docs create performance improvement report"
```

**Parallel Execution**:
- **Analysis Track**: Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- **Optimization Track**: Implementation of performance improvements  
- **Testing Track**: Creation of performance validation tests
- **Consolidation**: Integration of results into comprehensive report

### Example 3: Code Quality Enhancement (10 minutes)

```bash
# Conditional routing based on analysis results
/chain conditional --start="/query analyze code quality" \
  --routing="coverage_low:/task improve test coverage,security_issues:/task fix security vulnerabilities,performance_poor:/task optimize performance" \
  --completion="/docs update quality documentation"
```

**Conditional Logic**:
- **Coverage Analysis**: If coverage < 90%, trigger coverage improvement
- **Security Analysis**: If vulnerabilities found, trigger security fixes
- **Performance Analysis**: If performance issues detected, trigger optimization
- **Documentation**: Always update quality documentation with results

### Example 4: API Development Workflow (25 minutes)

```bash
# Complex workflow with multiple coordination points
/chain iterative --command="/feature" \
  --workflow="api-development" \
  --criteria="quality_gates_passing,documentation_complete,integration_tests_successful" \
  --max_iterations="3"
```

**Iterative Execution**:
1. **Iteration 1**: Basic API structure and core endpoints
2. **Iteration 2**: Error handling, validation, and security
3. **Iteration 3**: Performance optimization and comprehensive testing
4. **Validation**: Quality gates must pass before completion

## 🔧 Advanced Chaining Patterns

### State-Preserving Sequential Chains

```bash
# Research findings inform planning, planning guides implementation
/chain sequential --state-preservation="full" \
  --commands="/query detailed analysis,/feature comprehensive plan,/task implement core,/task add features,/task quality improvements" \
  --context-sharing="analysis_results,architecture_decisions,implementation_choices"
```

**State Management**:
- **Analysis Results**: Research findings available to all subsequent commands
- **Architecture Decisions**: Planning decisions inform implementation choices
- **Implementation Choices**: Development decisions guide quality improvements
- **Context Continuity**: Full workflow understanding maintained throughout

### Performance-Optimized Parallel Chains

```bash
# Maximum parallelization with coordination
/chain parallel --optimization="maximum" \
  --coordination="/swarm intelligent" \
  --workflows="frontend:(/task UI components),backend:(/task API endpoints),database:(/task schema and migrations),tests:(/task test suites)" \
  --integration="/task coordinate and validate integration"
```

**Parallel Optimization**:
- **Independent Execution**: Components developed simultaneously
- **Intelligent Coordination**: Swarm manages dependencies and integration points
- **Resource Optimization**: Maximum utilization of available processing capacity
- **Result Consolidation**: Coordinated integration of parallel development results

### Adaptive Conditional Chains

```bash
# Dynamic workflow adaptation based on complexity analysis
/chain adaptive --analysis="/query complexity assessment" \
  --simple_path="/task direct implementation" \
  --medium_path="/feature planned development" \
  --complex_path="/swarm multi-agent coordination" \
  --routing_criteria="complexity_score,team_size,time_constraints"
```

**Adaptive Routing**:
- **Complexity Assessment**: Framework analyzes and scores complexity
- **Simple Route**: Direct task execution for straightforward requirements
- **Medium Route**: Feature planning for moderate complexity
- **Complex Route**: Multi-agent coordination for sophisticated requirements
- **Dynamic Selection**: Route chosen based on analysis results

### Error-Resilient Recovery Chains

```bash
# Comprehensive error handling and recovery
/chain resilient --error-handling="comprehensive" \
  --primary-workflow="/feature main implementation" \
  --fallback-workflows="simplified:/task basic implementation,alternative:/query alternative approaches" \
  --recovery-strategy="rollback_and_retry,graceful_degradation,alternative_routing"
```

**Error Recovery**:
- **Primary Workflow**: Attempt sophisticated implementation first
- **Fallback Options**: Multiple alternative approaches available
- **Recovery Strategies**: Comprehensive error handling and rollback capabilities
- **Graceful Degradation**: Successful completion even with partial functionality
