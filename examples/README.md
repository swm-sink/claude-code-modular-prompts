- ✅ Expected outcomes clearly documented
- ✅ Time estimates for completion

### 3. **Independent Examples**
Each example can be completed standalone:
- No dependencies between examples
- Clear context and setup for each
- Complete solutions, not fragments

### 4. **Cross-Referenced Learning**
Examples link to relevant documentation:
- 📚 Related docs/ content
- 🔗 Command reference guides
- 💡 Best practice explanations

## 🏆 Success Criteria by Layer

### Layer 1: Quick Start Success
- [ ] Framework installed and working in 2 minutes
- [ ] First command executed successfully
- [ ] Basic PROJECT_CONFIG.xml customized
- [ ] Confidence to proceed to workflows

### Layer 2: Workflow Mastery

- [ ] Enterprise patterns implemented

## 🚨 Quick Troubleshooting

### Examples not working?
1. **Check framework installation**: Ensure `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/` exist in your project
2. **Verify permissions**: Run `chmod +x .claude/commands/*` if needed
3. **Update PROJECT_CONFIG.xml**: Customize for your specific project
4. **Start simpler**: Drop back to a more basic example if advanced ones fail

### Need help choosing?
- **First time user**: Start with hello-world
