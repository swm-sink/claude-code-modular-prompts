- [ ] Contribute to framework evolution

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Basic Requirements
- **Programming experience** (6+ months in any language)
- **Command line basics** and Git familiarity
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and configured

### By Level
- **🟢 Beginner**: Just basic programming knowledge
- **🟡 Intermediate**: Completed beginner examples + 1+ weeks framework usage  
- **🔴 Advanced**: Mastered workflow patterns + 1+ months experience

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Simple Path to Mastery
1. **🟢 Start with basics**: [01-beginner/getting-started.md](01-beginner/getting-started.md)
2. **🟡 Learn workflows**: [02-intermediate/multi-command-workflows/](02-intermediate/multi-command-workflows/)  
3. **🔴 Go advanced**: [03-advanced/](03-advanced/) when ready

### 🆘 Need Help?
- **Issues with setup**: Check [01-beginner/getting-started.md](01-beginner/getting-started.md)
- **Workflow questions**: Study the workflow examples carefully
- **Framework help**: Use `/help` command for assistance

---

**The key insight**: Framework mastery comes from **learning workflow patterns**, not memorizing commands. Focus on the **3 core workflows** in intermediate examples - they solve 80% of complex development problems!
