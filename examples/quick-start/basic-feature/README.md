# Basic Feature - Complete Development Cycle in 5 Minutes

> **Objective**: Experience end-to-end feature development from research to implementation with multi-file coordination and production-ready quality.

Having mastered single tasks, you're ready for complete feature development. This example demonstrates the full Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement workflow with multi-component coordination, quality gates, and production standards.

## üéØ 5-Minute Feature Development

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Completed [hello-world/](../hello-world/) and [first-task/](../first-task/)
- ‚úÖ Understanding of TDD workflow from previous examples
- ‚úÖ Framework responding consistently to commands

### Step 1: Setup Feature Environment (30 seconds)

```bash
# Copy feature-optimized configuration
cp /path/to/claude-code-modular-prompts/examples/quick-start/basic-feature/PROJECT_CONFIG.xml .

# Ensure proper project structure
mkdir -p src components tests docs
ls -la src/ components/ tests/ docs/
```

### Step 2: Research and Analysis (1 minute)

```bash
# Use framework to research and plan a complete feature
/query "analyze this project and suggest a simple but complete feature that would demonstrate multi-file coordination and real value"
```

**Framework suggests**: A complete feature like user input validation, data formatting, API client, or utility module with multiple components.

### Step 3: Feature Development Workflow (3 minutes)

```bash
# Execute complete feature development using the feature command
/feature "implement a user input validation system with multiple validators and a main validation coordinator"
```

**What happens** (the full Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement cycle):

1. **Research Phase**:
   - Framework analyzes requirements and breaks them down
   - Identifies necessary components and their interactions
   - Plans file structure and integration points

2. **Planning Phase**:
   - Creates feature specification and architecture
   - Defines interfaces between components
   - Plans test strategy and validation approach

3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Creates tests for each component (TDD RED)
   - Implements components one by one (TDD GREEN)
   - Integrates components with coordination logic
   - Refactors for quality and maintainability (TDD REFACTOR)

### Step 4: Validation and Review (30 seconds)

```bash
# Review what was implemented
/query "show me the complete feature implementation, explain the architecture, and validate that everything works together"

# Run tests to confirm quality
npm test  # or appropriate test command
```

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

After completing this feature, you should have:

- [ ] **Multiple coordinated files**: Several source files working together
- [ ] **Comprehensive test suite**: Tests for individual components and integration
- [ ] **Clear architecture**: Well-defined interfaces and separation of concerns
- [ ] **Production quality**: Code that meets quality gates and standards
- [ ] **Working integration**: Components that interact properly
- [ ] **Documentation**: Clear explanation of feature and usage

## üîç Feature Development Analysis

### For Different Project Types

**Enterprise Applications**:
```xml
<domain>enterprise-development</domain>
<rule>Implement comprehensive error handling and logging</rule>
<rule>Include performance monitoring and metrics</rule>
<rule>Ensure backward compatibility and versioning</rule>
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Feature scope too large?
```bash
# Ask for simpler scope
/query "break down the suggested feature into smaller, more manageable components"
```

### Integration issues between components?
```bash
# Let framework diagnose and fix
/task "fix integration issues and ensure all components work together properly"
```

### Quality gates failing?
```bash
# Review and improve quality
/query "analyze current code quality issues and suggest specific improvements"
```

### Want different feature architecture?
```bash
# Ask for alternatives
/query "suggest 3 different architectural approaches for this feature"
```
