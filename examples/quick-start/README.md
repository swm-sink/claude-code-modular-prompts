# Quick Start - 2-Minute Immediate Success

> **Guarantee**: Framework working in your project with successful command execution in under 2 minutes.

Welcome to the fastest path to Claude Code framework success! These examples are designed for immediate results - no learning curve, just copy, paste, and experience the power.

## ðŸŽ¯ 2-Minute Success Promise

Each example in this directory follows the same promise:
1. **30 seconds**: Copy files
2. **30 seconds**: Customize basic settings  
3. **60 seconds**: Execute first command and see results

**Total time**: Under 2 minutes to working framework and successful execution.

## ðŸš€ Available Quick Start Examples

### 1. [Hello World](hello-world/) - Framework First Contact
**Perfect for**: Absolute beginners, first-time framework users
**Time**: 2 minutes
**Outcome**: Framework responds to your first command

```bash
cd hello-world/
# Follow README - guaranteed immediate success
```

**What you'll achieve:**
- âœ… Framework installed and working
- âœ… First command executed successfully  
- âœ… Project analyzed by framework
- âœ… Confidence to explore further

---

### 2. [First Task](first-task/) - Single Task Execution
**Perfect for**: Developers ready to make their first code change
**Time**: 3 minutes (including small code modification)
**Outcome**: Working code change via framework

```bash
cd first-task/
# Execute your first real development task
```

**What you'll achieve:**
- âœ… Real code modification via `/task` command
- âœ… TDD cycle execution (REDâ†’GREENâ†’REFACTOR)
- âœ… Quality gates validation
- âœ… Understanding of task workflow

---

### 3. [Basic Feature](basic-feature/) - End-to-End Feature Development
**Perfect for**: Developers ready for a complete feature workflow
**Time**: 5 minutes (small feature from analysis to implementation)
**Outcome**: Complete feature delivered with tests

```bash
cd basic-feature/
# Experience full feature development cycle
```

**What you'll achieve:**
- âœ… Complete feature development workflow
- âœ… Research â†’ Plan â†’ Implement pattern
- âœ… Multi-file coordination
- âœ… Production-ready feature delivery

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### "Command not found" errors?
```bash
# Ensure you're in your project directory with framework files
ls CLAUDE.md .claude/
# If missing, copy framework files first
```

### "Permission denied" errors?
```bash
# Fix executable permissions
chmod +x .claude/commands/*
```

### Framework doesn't understand your project?
```bash
# Quick PROJECT_CONFIG.xml fix
/query "detect project type and suggest configuration"
```

### Still not working?
1. **Start simpler**: Try hello-world if first-task fails
2. **Check installation**: Verify all framework files copied correctly
3. **Review configuration**: Ensure PROJECT_CONFIG.xml matches your project
4. **Get help**: See [troubleshooting guide](../../docs/reference/troubleshooting.md)

## ðŸ“ˆ After Quick Start Success

### Immediate Next Steps (5-10 minutes)
- **Learn essential commands**: Try `/auto`, `/query`, `/feature`
- **Explore workflows**: Move to [examples/workflows/](../workflows/)
- **Customize configuration**: Update PROJECT_CONFIG.xml for your needs

### Same Day (30 minutes)
- **Master common patterns**: Practice research â†’ plan â†’ implement
- **Try team workflows**: Set up collaboration patterns
- **Explore documentation**: Understand command selection and best practices

### This Week
- **Advanced patterns**: Move to [examples/advanced/](../advanced/)
- **Framework mastery**: Custom modules and complex workflows
- **Team integration**: Deploy framework across your development team

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for Maximum Success

1. **Follow the progression**: hello-world â†’ first-task â†’ basic-feature
2. **Copy-paste first, understand later**: Get immediate success, then learn why
3. **Customize incrementally**: Start with minimal changes, add complexity gradually
4. **Celebrate small wins**: Each successful command builds framework confidence
5. **Share success**: Once working, show teammates the results
