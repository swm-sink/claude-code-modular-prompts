# Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the complete testing approach for the Research-Driven Context Engineering System transformation.

## Testing Levels

### Level 1: Unit Testing (Individual Commands)

#### Command Validation Tests
Each of the 30 commands must pass:
```yaml
Test Suite: Command Validation
For each command:
  - [ ] YAML frontmatter valid
  - [ ] Required fields present (name, description, usage, allowed-tools)
  - [ ] Numbering format correct ([phase]_[category]-{action})
  - [ ] Dependencies listed and valid
  - [ ] Produces declared outputs
  - [ ] Anti-patterns documented
  - [ ] Web search queries included (for research commands)
```

#### Research Command Specific Tests
```yaml
Test Suite: Research Validation
For each research command:
  - [ ] Minimum 5 search queries defined
  - [ ] Source evaluation criteria present
  - [ ] VERIFY protocol implemented
  - [ ] Conflict resolution process defined
  - [ ] Evidence format specified
  - [ ] Citation requirements met
```

### Level 2: Integration Testing (Command Chains)

#### Phase Progression Tests
```yaml
Test: Phase 0 → Phase 1 Flow
Steps:
  1. Run 0_verify-environment
  2. Verify output includes Claude Code version
  3. Run 0_verify-project  
  4. Verify framework detection works
  5. Run 1_research-framework
  6. Verify it uses detected framework
Expected: Smooth data flow between phases
```

#### Context Building Tests
```yaml
Test: Complete Context Generation
Steps:
  1. Run Phase 0-2 commands in sequence
  2. Verify .claude/CLAUDE.md created
  3. Check hierarchical structure
  4. Validate @-imports work
  5. Confirm no broken references
Expected: Working context system
```

### Level 3: System Testing (End-to-End)

#### New Project Setup Test
```yaml
Test: Fresh Project Setup
Environment: New React project
Steps:
  1. Add as git submodule
  2. Run /0_verify-environment
  3. Complete all Phase 0-1 commands
  4. Verify research results
  5. Build context with Phase 2
  6. Create agents with Phase 3
  7. Validate entire setup
Duration: 60-90 minutes
Success Criteria:
  - 15+ context files created
  - All files have citations
  - No hallucinated content
  - Anti-patterns prevented
```

#### Migration Test
```yaml
Test: Existing Project Migration
Environment: Project using v1.0
Steps:
  1. Run migration analyzer
  2. Preserve custom commands
  3. Transform to new format
  4. Validate nothing lost
  5. Test migrated commands
Success Criteria:
  - User customizations preserved
  - Evidence added to patterns
  - Smooth transition
```

### Level 4: Performance Testing

#### Token Usage Tests
```yaml
Test: Context Optimization
Measure:
  - Token count per command
  - Total context size
  - Compression effectiveness
  - Load time
Targets:
  - Average command: <800 tokens
  - Full context: <100k tokens
  - Compression: 30% reduction
  - Load time: <2 seconds
```

#### Search Performance Tests
```yaml
Test: Web Search Efficiency
Measure:
  - Search query execution time
  - Result quality score
  - Source validation time
  - Total research time
Targets:
  - Search execution: <5 seconds per query
  - Quality score: >80% relevant
  - Validation: <2 seconds per source
  - Total research: <15 minutes per domain
```

### Level 5: Security Testing

#### Anti-Pattern Prevention Tests
```yaml
Test: Hallucination Prevention
Attempts:
  1. Ask for "best practice" without source
  2. Request specific metrics
  3. Ask for outdated patterns
  4. Try to skip research
Expected: All attempts blocked with appropriate messages
```

#### Input Validation Tests
```yaml
Test: Malicious Input Handling
Attempts:
  1. Inject commands in search queries
  2. Path traversal in file operations
  3. Large input handling
  4. Special character handling
Expected: All inputs sanitized, no security breaches
```

### Level 6: Usability Testing

#### User Journey Tests
```yaml
Test: First-Time User Experience
Participants: 5 developers unfamiliar with system
Tasks:
  1. Set up for their project
  2. Create first agent
  3. Build custom command
  4. Run validation
Measure:
  - Time to first success
  - Error encounters
  - Documentation lookups
  - Satisfaction score
```

#### Documentation Tests
```yaml
Test: Documentation Completeness
Verify:
  - [ ] Every command has examples
  - [ ] All error messages documented
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guide complete
  - [ ] Video tutorials accurate
  - [ ] Migration guide tested
```

### Test Automation
```python
# Example test for command validation
def test_command_yaml_structure():
    """Verify all commands have valid YAML frontmatter"""
    command_files = glob.glob(".claude-context/scaffolding/**/*.md")
    
    for cmd_file in command_files:
        with open(cmd_file) as f:
            content = f.read()
            
        # Extract YAML frontmatter
        yaml_match = re.match(r'^---\n(.*?)\n---', content, re.DOTALL)
        assert yaml_match, f"No YAML frontmatter in {cmd_file}"
        
        # Parse YAML
        yaml_content = yaml.safe_load(yaml_match.group(1))
        
        # Verify required fields
        assert 'name' in yaml_content
        assert 'description' in yaml_content
        assert 'allowed-tools' in yaml_content
        
        # Verify naming convention
        name = yaml_content['name']
        assert re.match(r'^\d_\[[\w-]+\]-\{[\w-]+\}$', name)
```

### Continuous Testing
```yaml
CI Pipeline:
  on_commit:
    - Lint YAML frontmatter
    - Validate command structure
    - Check broken links
    - Run unit tests
  
  on_pull_request:
    - Full unit test suite
    - Integration tests
    - Documentation build
    
  nightly:
    - System tests
    - Performance benchmarks
    - Security scans
    
  weekly:
    - Usability tests with users
    - Migration tests
    - Full end-to-end validation
```

## Test Data Management

### Mock Search Results
Create realistic test data:
```json
{
  "query": "react best practices 2024",
  "results": [
    {
      "url": "https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react",
      "title": "Thinking in React – React",
      "authority": 10,
      "date": "2024-01",
      "relevant_content": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Sample Projects
Maintain test projects:
- `tests/fixtures/sample_projects/react-app/`
- `tests/fixtures/sample_projects/python-api/`
- `tests/fixtures/sample_projects/go-microservice/`

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Test Failures

#### YAML Parsing Errors
```
Error: YAML frontmatter invalid
Fix: Check for tabs vs spaces, missing colons
```

#### Search Timeout
```
Error: Web search exceeded 5s limit
Fix: Mock search results for tests, real search in integration only
```

#### Token Limit Exceeded
```
Error: Command exceeds 800 token target
Fix: Compress verbose sections, use references
```

## Testing Philosophy

1. **Test the Reality**: Don't test aspirational features
2. **Evidence Required**: Every test assertion needs justification
3. **Prevent Regressions**: What broke before must not break again
4. **User-Centric**: Test what users actually do
5. **Continuous**: Testing never stops, even after release
