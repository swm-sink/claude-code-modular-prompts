# Claude Code Native Testing Strategy

## Understanding Claude Code "Testing"

### What Testing Means in Claude Code Context
- **NOT** traditional unit tests with assertions
- **NOT** automated CI/CD test suites
- **IS** validation that commands guide Claude effectively
- **IS** ensuring commands produce desired outcomes

## Three-Layer Testing Approach

### Layer 1: Command Syntax Validation
**What**: Verify YAML frontmatter and structure
**How**: Simple bash script to check:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# validate-commands.sh
for cmd in .claude/commands/*.md; do
  # Check for required YAML fields
  grep -q "^name:" "$cmd" || echo "Missing name: $cmd"
  grep -q "^description:" "$cmd" || echo "Missing description: $cmd"
  grep -q "^allowed-tools:" "$cmd" || echo "Missing allowed-tools: $cmd"
done
```

### Layer 2: Outcome Testing (Manual)
**What**: Test that commands produce expected results
**How**: Run each command and verify:
1. Claude uses the specified tools
2. Output matches intended purpose
3. No hallucinations or drift
4. Completes in reasonable time

**Test Protocol**:
```markdown
## Test: /orchestrate
- [ ] Detects project type correctly
- [ ] Performs web searches
- [ ] Creates appropriate commands
- [ ] Generates CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Time: < 5 minutes

## Test: /project-analysis  
- [ ] Scans project structure
- [ ] Identifies patterns
- [ ] Provides actionable insights
- [ ] No false claims
- [ ] Time: < 3 minutes
```

### Layer 3: TDD for Command Development
**What**: Test-driven approach for creating new commands
**How**: Before creating a command:

1. **Define Expected Behavior**
   ```markdown
   Command: /new-feature
   Expected:
   - Uses Read to understand context
   - Uses WebSearch for best practices
   - Uses Write to create implementation
   - Completes in < 5 minutes
   ```

2. **Write Command to Meet Expectations**
   - Keep under 50 lines
   - Clear, action-oriented instructions
   - Specific tool usage

3. **Validate Against Expectations**
   - Run command in Claude Code
   - Check each expected behavior
   - Iterate until all pass

## Anti-Pattern Detection

### Common Failures to Test For
1. **Hallucination Triggers**
   - Ambiguous instructions
   - Missing context
   - Unclear success criteria

2. **Tool Misuse**
   - Using Bash for file operations instead of Read/Write
   - Forgetting to specify allowed-tools
   - Requesting tools not in allowed-tools

3. **Scope Creep**
   - Commands trying to do too much
   - Multi-phase processes in stateless environment
   - Promises of persistence

## Quality Gates

### Before Committing a Command
- [ ] Under 100 lines (ideally 40-50)
- [ ] Clear single purpose
- [ ] Specifies allowed-tools correctly
- [ ] Tested in actual Claude Code session
- [ ] Produces intended outcome
- [ ] No false promises

### Command Review Checklist
```markdown
## Command: [name]
- Syntax valid: ✓/✗
- Purpose clear: ✓/✗
- Tools appropriate: ✓/✗
- Instructions actionable: ✓/✗
- Tested manually: ✓/✗
- Outcome as expected: ✓/✗
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
1. Use command in real project
2. Note any issues or confusion
3. Update command to address issues
4. Test updated version
5. Document learnings

### Pattern Library
Maintain successful patterns:
- Commands that work well
- Effective prompt structures
- Tool usage patterns
- Common fixes for issues

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate
1. Validate all current commands syntax
2. Test top 5 commands manually
3. Document outcomes

### Short Term
1. Create test protocol for all commands
2. Build pattern library
3. Establish review process

### Long Term
1. Community testing feedback
2. Performance benchmarks
3. Success metrics tracking
