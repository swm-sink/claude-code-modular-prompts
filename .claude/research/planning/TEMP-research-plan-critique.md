# Research Plan Critique

## Strengths of Current Plan

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covers major aspects of Claude Code usage
2. **Structured Approach**: Clear phases and methodology
3. **Quality Criteria**: Defined metrics for source selection
4. **Organized Output**: Clear directory structure for findings

## Critical Gaps & Issues

### 1. **Search Strategy Limitations**
- **Problem**: Overly optimistic about finding 50 high-quality Claude Code sources
- **Reality Check**: Claude Code is relatively new; may not have 50 substantial implementations
- **Solution**: Broaden to include general LLM agent patterns applicable to Claude Code

### 2. **Anti-Pattern Awareness Missing**
- **Problem**: No mention of avoiding remediation theater in research
- **Risk**: May fall into pattern of inventing metrics or overstating findings
- **Solution**: Add explicit factual reporting requirements

### 3. **Practical Constraints Ignored**
- **Problem**: Timeline assumes continuous 12-hour execution
- **Reality**: Need adaptive approach with checkpoints
- **Solution**: Break into smaller, measurable milestones

### 4. **Source Verification Missing**
- **Problem**: No process for verifying sources actually use Claude Code
- **Risk**: May include irrelevant or outdated content
- **Solution**: Add verification checklist

### 5. **Native Agentic Abilities Undefined**
- **Problem**: "Native agentic abilities" needs clear definition
- **Clarification Needed**: 
  - Tool usage (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)
  - Multi-step planning and execution
  - Self-directed problem solving
  - Context management

### 6. **Research Methodology Too Linear**
- **Problem**: Assumes we'll find sources in neat categories
- **Reality**: May need iterative, adaptive approach
- **Solution**: Add feedback loops and pivot points

### 7. **Synthesis Approach Vague**
- **Problem**: "Deep synthesis" not clearly defined
- **Risk**: May produce superficial summaries
- **Solution**: Define specific synthesis outputs and formats

### 8. **No Fallback Strategy**
- **Problem**: What if we can't find 50 quality sources?
- **Options**:
  - Focus on depth over quantity
  - Include related LLM agent research
  - Create original examples based on patterns

### 9. **Missing Practical Testing**
- **Problem**: No plan to validate discovered patterns
- **Risk**: May document patterns that don't work
- **Solution**: Add validation step for key patterns

### 10. **Scope Creep Risk**
- **Problem**: "Research deeply" is unbounded
- **Risk**: May spend excessive time on few sources
- **Solution**: Time-box research per source

## Recommended Adjustments

1. **Redefine Success**: 25-50 sources with emphasis on quality
2. **Add Verification**: Source must demonstrate actual Claude Code usage
3. **Include Anti-Patterns**: Document what NOT to do
4. **Practical Focus**: Prioritize actionable patterns
5. **Iterative Process**: Research → Verify → Synthesize → Validate
6. **Clear Boundaries**: Define "native agentic abilities" explicitly
7. **Factual Reporting**: No invented metrics or theatrical language
8. **Adaptive Milestones**: Checkpoints every 10 sources

## Updated Success Criteria

Instead of "50 sources at any cost", aim for:
- 25+ verified Claude Code implementations
- 10+ unique prompt engineering patterns
- 5+ context engineering strategies
- Practical examples that can be tested
- Clear documentation of what works vs. what doesn't
- Honest assessment of Claude Code ecosystem maturity
