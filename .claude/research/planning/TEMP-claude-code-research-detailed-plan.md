# Claude Code Research: Detailed Implementation Plan

## Objective Clarification

**Primary Goal**: Research and document 25-50 high-quality sources demonstrating Claude Code's native agentic abilities, with focus on prompt and context engineering patterns.

**Native Agentic Abilities Defined**:
1. Tool usage (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, WebSearch, etc.)
2. Multi-step planning with TodoWrite
3. Self-directed problem solving
4. Context management via CLAUDE.md
5. Slash command creation and usage
6. Autonomous workflow execution

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (30 min)

### Tasks:
1. Create `.claude/research/` directory structure
2. Set up tracking documents
3. Define verification criteria
4. Create research templates

### Quality Gates:
- [ ] Directory structure matches plan
- [ ] Templates include anti-pattern warnings
- [ ] Verification checklist created

## Phase 2: Initial Discovery (2 hours)

### Search Strategy:
1. **Official Sources** (Target: 5-10)
   - search.anthropic.com for Claude Code
   - docs.anthropic.com/claude-code
   - github.com/anthropics repositories

2. **GitHub Search Queries**:
   ```
   - "CLAUDE.md" in:path
   - "claude code" ".claude/commands"
   - "slash commands" "claude code"
   - ".claude/settings.json" in:path
   - "TodoWrite" "claude" in:file
   ```

3. **Community Sources**:
   - Reddit r/claudeai for Claude Code posts
   - Twitter/X: #ClaudeCode hashtag
   - Dev.to, Medium for tutorials

### Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Contains actual Claude Code implementation
- [ ] Shows tool usage or slash commands
- [ ] Includes CLAUDE.md or .claude structure
- [ ] Demonstrates agentic workflow
- [ ] Not just Claude API usage

### Quality Gate:
- Minimum 10 verified sources before proceeding
- Each source documented with verification status

## Phase 3: Deep Research (3 hours)

### Research Process per Source:
1. **Quick Scan** (5 min max)
   - Verify Claude Code usage
   - Identify key patterns
   - Rate relevance (1-5)

2. **Deep Dive** (10 min max for 4-5 rated)
   - Extract code examples
   - Document patterns
   - Note innovations

3. **Documentation**:
   ```markdown
   ## Source [#]: [Title]
   - **URL**: 
   - **Type**: Official/Community/Tutorial/Research
   - **Verified**: ✓ Uses Claude Code
   - **Rating**: X/5
   - **Key Patterns**:
   - **Code Examples**:
   - **Insights**:
   ```

### Adaptive Checkpoints:
- Every 10 sources: Assess quality and adjust strategy
- If < 25 quality sources found: Pivot to creating examples
- If patterns repeat: Focus on unique implementations

## Phase 4: Synthesis & Organization (2 hours)

### Synthesis Approach:

1. **Pattern Extraction**:
   - Group similar patterns
   - Identify unique approaches
   - Document anti-patterns observed

2. **Topic Organization**:
   ```
   .claude/research/
   ├── README.md                    # Navigation and overview
   ├── sources/
   │   ├── verified-sources.md      # All verified sources

       ├── anti-patterns.md        # What to avoid
       └── gaps-opportunities.md   # What's missing
   ```

3. **Content Requirements**:
   - Factual descriptions only
   - Code examples must be complete
   - Clear attribution to sources
   - No invented metrics

## Phase 5: Validation & Review (1 hour)

### Validation Steps:
1. Test 3-5 key patterns in our project
2. Verify code examples are syntactically correct
3. Check for completeness and clarity
4. Remove any theatrical language

### Final Quality Gates:
- [ ] 25+ verified sources documented
- [ ] 10+ unique patterns identified
- [ ] 5+ practical examples created
- [ ] No fabricated metrics or claims
- [ ] Clear navigation and organization
- [ ] Anti-patterns documented

## Execution Timeline

```
Hour 1: Setup + Official sources
Hour 2-3: GitHub discovery + verification  
Hour 4-5: Deep research on best sources
Hour 6-7: Pattern synthesis + organization
Hour 8: Validation + final review
```

## Fallback Strategies

1. **If < 25 sources**: 
   - Include general LLM agent patterns
   - Create original examples
   - Focus on depth over breadth

2. **If time constrained**:
   - Prioritize official + highest rated
   - Quick synthesis of key patterns
   - Mark as "Phase 1" with expansion plan

3. **If patterns unclear**:
   - Create test implementations
   - Document what doesn't work
   - Note areas needing research

## Success Metrics (Factual)

- Number of verified sources: [actual count]
- Unique patterns documented: [actual count]
- Practical examples: [actual count]
- Time invested: [actual hours]
- Coverage of defined abilities: [checklist]

## Anti-Pattern Prevention

1. **No Theater**: Simple, factual language only
2. **No Fake Metrics**: Only count what's measured
3. **No Overpromising**: Document actual findings
4. **No Speculation**: Mark unknowns clearly
5. **Attribution**: Credit all sources properly

## Next Steps After Research

1. Apply findings to our project
2. Test promising patterns
3. Create project-specific adaptations
4. Update our CLAUDE.md based on learnings
5. Share findings with community (optional)
