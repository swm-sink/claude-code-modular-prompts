## Purpose

Establishes comprehensive security documentation standards to ensure all security-related content is properly contextualized and educational rather than exploitative.

## Security Content Classification

### Defensive Security Content (APPROVED)
- Threat modeling methodologies (STRIDE, DREAD)
- Security analysis patterns and frameworks
- Vulnerability assessment for defensive purposes
- Security research for protective measures
- Incident response and forensics

### Educational Security Content (APPROVED WITH DISCLAIMERS)
- Security persona thinking patterns
- Theoretical security analysis examples
- Academic security research references
- Best practices and standards documentation

### Mathematical/Technical Terms (NO SECURITY CONCERN)
- Algorithm optimization terminology (exploration/exploitation)
- Mathematical optimization concepts
- Bayesian optimization acquisition functions
- Marketing terminology (growth hacking)

## Required Security Disclaimers

### For Security Analysis Content
```xml
<security_context>NOTE: All security analysis is for DEFENSIVE purposes - protecting systems against threats</security_context>
```

### For Threat Modeling Content
```xml
<security_disclaimer>IMPORTANT: All threat analysis conducted for defensive security measures to evaluate and prioritize protective controls</security_disclaimer>
```

### For Security Research Content
```xml
<ethical_framework>CRITICAL: All security research conducted for DEFENSIVE and EDUCATIONAL purposes only - protecting systems, not attacking them</ethical_framework>
```

### For Security Personas
```xml
<defensive_context>IMPORTANT: All security analysis performed for DEFENSIVE purposes - understanding attack vectors to build better protections</defensive_context>
```

## Content Review Guidelines

### LOW-RISK Patterns (Reviewed and Approved)
1. **"exploit" in security thinking patterns** - APPROVED with defensive context
2. **"Exploitability" in DREAD methodology** - APPROVED with educational disclaimer
3. **"exploit development" in research context** - APPROVED with defensive clarification
4. **"exploitation" in optimization algorithms** - APPROVED as mathematical terminology
5. **"exploration-exploitation" in Bayesian optimization** - APPROVED as technical terminology
6. **"hack" in marketing context** - APPROVED as business terminology

### BLOCKED Patterns (Zero Tolerance)
- Actual exploit code or techniques
- Malicious payload examples
- Attack instructions or tutorials
- Weaponized security tools
- Real vulnerability details without defensive context

## Implementation Standards

### Documentation Requirements
- All security content MUST include appropriate disclaimers
- Educational examples MUST be clearly marked as theoretical
- Security personas MUST emphasize defensive purposes
- Research content MUST include ethical frameworks

### Validation Requirements
- Security content review before publication
- Disclaimer presence verification
- Context appropriateness assessment
- Educational vs. exploitative determination

## Continuous Monitoring

### Automated Scanning
- Regular security pattern detection
- Context validation checks
- Disclaimer presence verification
- Content appropriateness assessment

### Manual Review Triggers
- New security content creation
- Security documentation updates
- Persona modification requests
- Research methodology additions
