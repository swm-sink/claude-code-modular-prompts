# Security Guidelines for Claude Code Modular Prompts

## Overview
This document outlines security best practices and remediation measures implemented in Step 87.

## Security Issues Addressed

### Critical Issues (Fixed)
1. **Credential Exposure**: Sanitized example credentials in documentation files
2. **JWT Token Exposure**: Replaced real JWT tokens with sanitized examples
3. **Password Examples**: Replaced hardcoded passwords with placeholder examples

### High Severity Issues (Mitigated)
1. **Code Injection Risks**: Added security warnings and safer alternatives
2. **System Calls**: Annotated system() calls with security warnings
3. **Dynamic Code Execution**: Replaced exec() with safer import patterns

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Credential Management
- Never commit real credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement credential rotation policies
- Use sanitized examples in documentation

### 2. Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize file paths to prevent traversal
- Escape shell commands
- Implement size limits on file operations

### 3. Code Injection Prevention
- Avoid exec(), eval(), and system() calls when possible
- Use subprocess with shell=False for external commands
- Validate all dynamic code execution
- Implement input sanitization

### 4. File Security
- Restrict file access to allowed directories
- Implement file size and type restrictions
- Use canonical paths to prevent traversal attacks
- Log file access attempts

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Security Configuration
Location: `.claude/security_config.json`
- Defines security policies and restrictions
- Configures monitoring and alerting
- Sets validation rules and file restrictions

### Security Validator
Location: `.claude/security_validator.py`
- Ongoing security monitoring script
- Detects credential exposure patterns
- Identifies injection risk patterns
- Generates security audit reports

## Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring identifies security issues
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems/files
4. **Remediation**: Apply fixes and patches
5. **Validation**: Verify fixes are effective
6. **Documentation**: Update security guidelines

## Regular Security Tasks

1. **Weekly**: Run security validator script
2. **Monthly**: Review and update security policies
3. **Quarterly**: Comprehensive security audit
4. **Annually**: Security architecture review
