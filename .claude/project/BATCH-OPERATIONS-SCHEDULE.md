# BATCH OPERATIONS SCHEDULE
## Efficiency-Optimized Task Scheduling for 100-Step Implementation

*Generated: 2025-07-30*
*Purpose: Maximize efficiency through intelligent operation batching*
*Methodology: Context switching minimization + parallel execution optimization*

## 🎯 BATCHING STRATEGY OVERVIEW

### Efficiency Principles
- **Context Switching Minimization**: Group similar tasks to reduce cognitive overhead
- **Resource Optimization**: Batch operations that use similar tools and resources
- **Parallel Execution**: Schedule independent tasks concurrently
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Respect task dependencies while maximizing parallelism
- **Agent Specialization**: Align batches with sub-agent expertise

### Efficiency Targets
```yaml
Efficiency_Improvements:
  context_switching_reduction: ≥70%
  parallel_execution_increase: ≥60%
  overall_completion_time: -40%
  resource_utilization: ≥85%
  coordination_overhead: ≤10%
```
