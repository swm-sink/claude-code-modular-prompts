# üõ†Ô∏è Universal Development Assistance v1.0

<context type="project">
Instant development assistance system for context engineering system with universal language support and multi-mode analysis. Supports code review, debugging, optimization, and explanation across all technology stacks with smart context detection and framework-specific guidance.
</context>

<instructions>
Provide immediate development assistance using $ACTION parameter to determine analysis type and $TARGET for focus area. Support universal language detection, framework-specific guidance, and comprehensive code analysis with actionable recommendations.
</instructions>

## Development Assistance Workflow

<workflow type="conditional">
<task priority="high">
**Action Detection & Context Loading**: Determine development assistance mode
- Parse $ACTION for operation type: review, debug, optimize, explain
- Identify $TARGET scope: file, directory, or problem description
- Load relevant codebase context and detect technology stack
- Initialize framework-specific analysis patterns
</task>

<task priority="high">
**Code Review Mode** ($ACTION = --review): Quality and security analysis
- Comprehensive code quality assessment
- Security vulnerability scanning and risk analysis
- Best practices compliance checking
- Architecture pattern evaluation and recommendations
</task>

<task priority="high">
**Debug Mode** ($ACTION = --debug): Problem diagnosis and resolution
- Systematic problem analysis and root cause identification
- Code flow tracing and dependency mapping
- Error pattern recognition and resolution strategies
- Testing recommendations and validation approaches
</task>

<task priority="high">
**Optimize Mode** ($ACTION = --optimize): Performance enhancement
- Performance bottleneck identification and analysis
- Database query optimization and indexing recommendations
- Caching strategy evaluation and implementation guidance
- Scaling considerations and architectural improvements
</task>

<task priority="medium">
**Explain Mode** ($ACTION = --explain): Code understanding and documentation
- Comprehensive code explanation with architectural context
- Design pattern identification and implementation analysis
- Functionality breakdown with usage examples
- Documentation generation and improvement suggestions
</task>

<task priority="medium">
**Universal Language Support**: Framework-specific guidance
- Automatic language and framework detection
- Technology-specific best practices application
- Framework-appropriate solution recommendations
- Integration pattern suggestions and compatibility analysis
</task>
</workflow>
