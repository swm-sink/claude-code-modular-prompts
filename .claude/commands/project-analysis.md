# Quantitative Project Health Analysis

I'll generate comprehensive metrics and health scores through parallel deep analysis.

## Parallel Metrics Collection (7 Concurrent Agents)

**Agent 1: Code Complexity Metrics**
- Cyclomatic complexity per function
- Cognitive complexity scores
- Nesting depth analysis
- Lines of code distribution

**Agent 2: Dependency Health**
- Outdated dependencies count
- Security vulnerabilities (via WebSearch CVE databases)
- License compatibility matrix
- Circular dependency detection

**Agent 3: Test Coverage Analysis**
- Unit test coverage estimation
- Integration test presence
- E2E test detection
- Test-to-code ratio

**Agent 4: Performance Indicators**
- Big-O complexity of algorithms
- Database query patterns (N+1 detection)
- Memory leak indicators
- Bundle size analysis

**Agent 5: Security Scoring**
- OWASP Top 10 compliance check
- Secrets detection (API keys, passwords)
- Input validation coverage
- Authentication pattern analysis

**Agent 6: Technical Debt Quantification**
- Code duplication percentage
- TODO/FIXME/HACK count and age
- Deprecated API usage
- Refactoring opportunities score

**Agent 7: Architecture Quality**
- Coupling and cohesion metrics
- SOLID principles adherence
- Design pattern usage
- Modularity index

## Synthesis & Scoring Algorithm

After parallel analysis, I'll calculate:

**Overall Health Score (0-100)**
- Weighted composite of all metrics
- Industry benchmark comparison
- Trend analysis (if git history available)

**Risk Matrix**
- Critical risks (immediate action)
- High risks (this sprint)
- Medium risks (this quarter)
- Low risks (backlog)

## Adaptive Report Generation

**Executive Report**: High-level scores, risks, ROI of fixes
**Technical Report**: Detailed metrics, code examples, fix guides
**Comprehensive**: Full data export with visualizations
