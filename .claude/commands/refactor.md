# Code Refactoring

I'll help you improve code structure without changing behavior.

## Refactoring Types

- **Extract**: Pull out functions, components, modules
- **Rename**: Variables, functions, files with updates
- **Simplify**: Reduce complexity, improve readability
- **Optimize**: Performance improvements
- **Modernize**: Update to current best practices

## Safe Refactoring Process

1. **Analyze Current Code**
   - Understand existing behavior
   - Identify dependencies
   - Find test coverage

2. **Plan Changes**
   - Small, incremental steps
   - Preserve functionality
   - Maintain backwards compatibility

3. **Execute Refactoring**
   - Make targeted changes
   - Update all references
   - Preserve formatting style

4. **Verify Safety**
   - Check no behavior changed
   - Ensure tests still pass
   - Review performance impact

## Common Refactorings

- Extract repeated code into functions
- Simplify complex conditionals
- Break up large functions
- Improve naming clarity
- Remove dead code
