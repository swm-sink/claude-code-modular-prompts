# Create Unit Tests

I'll create comprehensive unit tests for your code following TDD best practices.

## My Testing Approach

1. **Analyze the Code**
   - Read the target file to understand its functions
   - Identify all testable units (functions, methods, classes)
   - Understand dependencies and edge cases

2. **Research Testing Patterns**
   - Search for testing best practices for your language/framework
   - Find common test patterns for similar code
   - Identify what makes a good test

3. **Write Comprehensive Tests**
   - Create test file with proper naming convention
   - Write tests for happy paths
   - Add edge case tests
   - Include error handling tests
   - Ensure good test descriptions

## What You'll Get

A complete test file that:
- Tests all public functions/methods
- Covers edge cases and error conditions
- Uses appropriate assertions
- Follows your project's testing conventions
- Includes clear test descriptions
