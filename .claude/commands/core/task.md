# /task - Focused Development Workflow for [INSERT_PROJECT_NAME]

I'll help you implement a specific development task using best practices for [INSERT_TECH_STACK] projects, with appropriate testing and quality standards for your [INSERT_DOMAIN] domain.

## Usage
```bash
/task "create email validation utility function"
/task "implement user authentication middleware"
/task "add pagination to the user listing component"
/task "create secure API endpoint for user data"
```

## Approach

1. **Analysis**: Understand the task requirements and context
2. **Design**: Plan the implementation approach
3. **Implementation**: Write clean, maintainable code
4. **Testing**: Add appropriate tests for the functionality
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation

I'll follow [INSERT_COMPANY_NAME]'s coding standards and use [INSERT_TESTING_FRAMEWORK] for testing when appropriate.
