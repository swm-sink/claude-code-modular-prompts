# Query lusaka Codebase

I'll help you understand any aspect of **lusaka** with deep knowledge of **Python** patterns and **Python** idioms.

## Query Capabilities

### Code Understanding
Ask about your Python implementation:
- "How does authentication work?"
- "Where is the payment processing logic?"
- "What design patterns are used?"
- "How is PostgreSQL accessed?"

### Architecture Analysis
Understand lusaka structure:
- "What's the overall architecture?"
- "How are services organized?"
- "Where are the RESTful endpoints?"
- "How is state managed?"

### Dependency Mapping
Explore Python dependencies:
- "What external libraries are used?"
- "Which components depend on X?"
- "What are the circular dependencies?"
- "How are modules connected?"

### Performance Insights
For balanced systems:
- "Where are the performance bottlenecks?"
- "What's cached and how?"
- "Which queries are optimized?"
- "Where might scaling issues occur?"

## Domain-Specific Understanding

### software-development Patterns
I understand patterns specific to software-development:
- Business logic organization
- Domain model structure
- Industry-specific requirements
- Compliance considerations

### devops-focused Practices
