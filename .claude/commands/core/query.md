# Query [INSERT_PROJECT_NAME] Codebase

I'll help you understand any aspect of **[INSERT_PROJECT_NAME]** with deep knowledge of **[INSERT_TECH_STACK]** patterns and **[INSERT_PRIMARY_LANGUAGE]** idioms.

## Query Capabilities

### Code Understanding
Ask about your [INSERT_TECH_STACK] implementation:
- "How does authentication work?"
- "Where is the payment processing logic?"
- "What design patterns are used?"
- "How is [INSERT_DATABASE_TYPE] accessed?"

### Architecture Analysis
Understand [INSERT_PROJECT_NAME] structure:
- "What's the overall architecture?"
- "How are services organized?"
- "Where are the [INSERT_API_STYLE] endpoints?"
- "How is state managed?"

### Dependency Mapping
Explore [INSERT_PRIMARY_LANGUAGE] dependencies:
- "What external libraries are used?"
- "Which components depend on X?"
- "What are the circular dependencies?"
- "How are modules connected?"

### Performance Insights
For [INSERT_PERFORMANCE_PRIORITY] systems:
- "Where are the performance bottlenecks?"
- "What's cached and how?"
- "Which queries are optimized?"
- "Where might scaling issues occur?"
