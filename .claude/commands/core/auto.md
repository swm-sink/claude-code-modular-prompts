# /auto - Intelligent Command Router for [INSERT_PROJECT_NAME]

I'll analyze your request and automatically route it to the most appropriate command for your [INSERT_DOMAIN] project using [INSERT_TECH_STACK].

## How It Works

This command analyzes your natural language request and routes it to the best available command in your [INSERT_PROJECT_NAME] prompt library.
## Usage
```bash
/auto "fix the authentication bug in the login system"
/auto "add user profile editing functionality"  
/auto "analyze the performance bottleneck in our API"
/auto "refactor the database connection logic safely"
```

## Examples

**Development Tasks:**
- `/auto "implement user authentication"`
- `/auto "fix the database connection issue"`

**Analysis & Research:**
- `/auto "analyze performance bottlenecks"`
- `/auto "research best practices for [INSERT_TECH_STACK]"`

I'll route your request to the most appropriate command and provide you with the best implementation approach for your [INSERT_PROJECT_NAME] project.
