## Example Sessions

**Code Review:**
```
👤 /quick-dev --review src/payment/checkout.js
🤖 Analyzing checkout.js...
🤖 Found 3 issues:
   1. Missing error handling for API calls
   2. Sensitive data logging in line 45
   3. Consider extracting validation logic
🤖 Here are the fixes...
```

**Debugging:**
```
