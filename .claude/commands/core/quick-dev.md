## Universal Development Support

**üîç What I'll analyze:**
- Code quality and best practices
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities  
- Architecture patterns
- Testing coverage gaps

**üöÄ What I'll provide:**
- Specific, actionable suggestions
- Code examples and fixes
- Architecture recommendations
- Performance improvements
- Security enhancements

## Language & Framework Agnostic

**Works with any tech stack:**
- Frontend: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, vanilla JS
- Backend: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Rust, C#, PHP
- Mobile: React Native, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin
- Databases: SQL, NoSQL, Redis, etc.
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP

## Example Sessions

**Code Review:**
```
üë§ /quick-dev --review src/payment/checkout.js
ü§ñ Analyzing checkout.js...
ü§ñ Found 3 issues:
   1. Missing error handling for API calls
   2. Sensitive data logging in line 45
   3. Consider extracting validation logic
ü§ñ Here are the fixes...
```

**Debugging:**
```
üë§ /quick-dev --debug "users can't log in"
ü§ñ Let me examine your authentication flow...
ü§ñ Found the issue: session timeout is too short
ü§ñ Here's the fix and why it happens...
```

## Smart Context Detection

I'll automatically:
- **Detect** your programming language and framework
- **Read** relevant files to understand context
- **Apply** language-specific best practices
- **Suggest** framework-appropriate solutions
- **Follow** your existing code patterns

## When to Use Different Dev Commands

- **`/quick-dev`**: Immediate help, any project *(this command)*
- **`/dev`**: Enhanced features after `/adapt-to-project`
- **`/dev-setup`**: Environment and tooling setup (after customization)

## Ready for Development Help?

Just specify what you need help with:

```
/quick-dev --review [file-or-description]
/quick-dev --debug [problem-description]  
/quick-dev --optimize [area-to-improve]
/quick-dev --explain [code-or-concept]
```

I'll analyze your code and provide specific, actionable guidance!
