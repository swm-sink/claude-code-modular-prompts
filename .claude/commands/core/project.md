# /project - Comprehensive Project Management Suite v2.0

<context type="project">
Unified project management system for lusaka template library supporting 7 operational modes: setup, provision, workflow, schedule, track, rollback, and run. Handles complete project lifecycle from development environment setup through production deployment and monitoring.
</context>

<instructions>
Execute comprehensive project management operations using $MODE parameter to determine operation type. Process $TARGET for environment/workflow specification and $OPTIONS for additional configuration. Support cross-mode integration and state management.
</instructions>

## Project Management Workflow

<workflow type="conditional">
<task priority="high">
**Mode Detection & Validation**: Parse and validate operation mode
- Identify operation mode: setup, provision, workflow, schedule, track, rollback, run
- Validate target environment and options
- Load project context and configuration
- Check prerequisites and permissions
</task>

<task priority="high">
**Setup Mode**: Environment and development setup ($MODE = setup)
- Environment analysis and dependency resolution
- Toolchain installation and configuration
- IDE setup and development workflow configuration
- Environment file generation and validation
</task>

<task priority="high">
**Provision Mode**: Infrastructure provisioning ($MODE = provision)
- Infrastructure assessment and planning
- Cloud resource provisioning with IaC
- Security hardening and compliance setup
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
</task>

<task priority="high">
**Workflow Mode**: Workflow orchestration ($MODE = workflow)
- DAG construction and task orchestration
- Parallel execution and resource management
- State management and progress monitoring
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
</task>

<task priority="medium">
**Schedule Mode**: Workflow scheduling ($MODE = schedule)
- Time-based and event-driven scheduling
- Resource optimization and conflict management
- Monitoring and performance analytics
- Integration with external scheduling systems
</task>

<task priority="medium">
**Track Mode**: Progress tracking and analytics ($MODE = track)
- Real-time monitoring and dashboard generation
- Performance analytics and predictive insights
- Resource utilization tracking
- Executive reporting and KPI generation
</task>

<task priority="medium">
**Rollback Mode**: Deployment rollback operations ($MODE = rollback)
- Version analysis and impact assessment
- Automated rollback execution with data integrity
- Service continuity and validation testing
- Incident documentation and reporting
</task>

<task priority="medium">
**Run Mode**: CI/CD operations ($MODE = run)
- Pipeline orchestration and quality gates
- Automated testing and deployment execution
- Real-time monitoring and results analysis
- Failure handling and recovery procedures
</task>
</workflow>
