# üéØ Instant Code Quality Analysis

**Universal code quality checker - works immediately with any language or framework!**

## Quick Quality Checks

### Full Project Scan
```
/quick-quality --scan
/quick-quality --scan src/
```

### Fix Quality Issues
```
/quick-quality --fix src/components/
/quick-quality --fix "fix all ESLint errors"
```

### Quality Report
```
/quick-quality --report
/quick-quality --report --detailed
```

## What Gets Analyzed

**üîç Code Quality Metrics:**

- Performance anti-patterns
- Error handling completeness
- Code duplication
- Naming conventions

**üìä Best Practice Checks:**
- Language-specific conventions
- Framework best practices
- Architecture patterns
- Testing completeness
- Documentation quality

## Universal Language Support

**Automatically detects and analyzes:**

**Frontend**: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue, Angular, HTML, CSS
**Backend**: Python, Java, Go, Rust, C#, PHP, Ruby, Node.js
**Mobile**: Swift, Kotlin, React Native, Flutter/Dart
**Data**: SQL, R, Jupyter Notebooks, pandas
**Config**: Docker, YAML, JSON, XML

- Provides additional insights beyond standard linters
- Language-agnostic analysis across polyglot codebases

## When to Use Quality Commands

- **`/quick-quality`**: Immediate analysis, any project *(this command)*
- **`/quality`**: Enhanced checks after `/adapt-to-project`
- **`/quality-enforce`**: Automated quality gates (after customization)

## Start Your Quality Check

Choose your analysis type:

```
/quick-quality --scan                    # Analyze entire project
/quick-quality --scan src/               # Analyze specific directory
/quick-quality --fix                     # Fix identified issues
/quick-quality --report --detailed       # Comprehensive quality report
```
