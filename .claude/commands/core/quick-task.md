# üéØ Universal Task Execution

**Works with any project, any language, any framework - no setup required!**

## How to Use

Simply describe what you want to accomplish:

```
/quick-task "add user authentication to my app"
/quick-task "refactor this component to use TypeScript"
/quick-task "optimize database queries in the user service"
/quick-task "add unit tests for the payment module"
/quick-task "set up CI/CD pipeline"
```

## What I'll Do

1. **üîç Analyze** your project structure and tech stack
2. **üìã Plan** the task with clear steps
3. **‚ö° Execute** the work using best practices
4. **‚úÖ Validate** the results

## Universal Approach

**Language Agnostic**: Works with JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust, C#, PHP, etc.

**Framework Flexible**: Adapts to React, Vue, Django, Spring, Express, Flask, etc.

**Context Aware**: I'll examine your project to understand:
- File structure and organization
- Dependencies and tech stack
- Coding patterns and conventions
- Testing setup and preferences

## Example: Adding Authentication

**You say**: `/quick-task "add user authentication"`

**I'll do**:
1. Scan your project to identify tech stack
2. Choose appropriate auth approach (JWT, sessions, OAuth)
3. Implement auth middleware/components
4. Add login/logout endpoints
5. Create authentication tests
6. Update documentation

## When to Use Each Task Command

- **`/quick-task`**: Works immediately, any project *(this command)*
- **`/task`**: Full-featured after running `/adapt-to-project`
- **`/project-task`**: Complex multi-file changes (after customization)

## Ready to Start?

Just tell me what you want to accomplish! I'll handle the technical details and adapt to your project's specific needs.

Example: `/quick-task "your specific goal here"`
