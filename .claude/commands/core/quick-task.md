# üéØ Universal Task Execution v1.0

<context type="project">
Universal task execution system for template library with intelligent project analysis, language-agnostic implementation, and framework-flexible approach. Works immediately with any project structure without setup or configuration requirements.
</context>

<instructions>
Execute $TASK_DESCRIPTION using comprehensive project analysis, intelligent tech stack detection, and adaptive implementation strategies. Provide structured approach with analysis, planning, execution, and validation phases for universal compatibility.
</instructions>

<example>
<input>/quick-task "add user authentication to my app"</input>
<expected_output>Complete authentication system implementation with middleware, endpoints, tests, and documentation</expected_output>
</example>
<example>
<input>/quick-task "refactor this component to use TypeScript"</input>
<expected_output>Component conversion to TypeScript with proper typing, interface definitions, and compilation validation</expected_output>
</example>
<example>
<input>/quick-task "optimize database queries in the user service"</input>
<expected_output>Query optimization with performance analysis, indexing recommendations, and implementation improvements</expected_output>
</example>
<example>
<input>/quick-task "add unit tests for the payment module"</input>
<expected_output>Comprehensive test suite with edge cases, mocking strategies, and coverage validation</expected_output>
</example>
</examples>

## Universal Task Execution Workflow

<workflow type="sequential">
<task priority="high">
**Project Analysis & Tech Stack Detection**: Intelligent codebase examination
- Analyze project structure and file organization
- Detect programming languages, frameworks, and dependencies
- Identify existing patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions
- Assess testing setup, build tools, and development environment
</task>

<task priority="high">
**Task Planning & Strategy Development**: Adaptive approach formulation
- Parse $TASK_DESCRIPTION for specific requirements and scope
- Develop implementation strategy based on detected tech stack
- Create step-by-step execution plan with validation checkpoints
- Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies
</task>

<task priority="high">
**Implementation Execution**: Best practices application
- Execute planned implementation using framework-appropriate patterns
- Follow detected coding conventions and architectural styles
- Implement comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
- Ensure code quality and maintainability standards
</task>

<task priority="medium">
**Testing & Validation**: Quality assurance and verification
- Create appropriate tests based on detected testing framework
- Validate implementation against requirements and edge cases
- Perform integration testing and compatibility verification
- Update documentation and provide usage examples
</task>
</workflow>
