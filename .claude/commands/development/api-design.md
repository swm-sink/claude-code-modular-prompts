# API Design for lusaka

I'll help you design **RESTful** APIs following **[INSERT_software-development_STANDARDS]** best practices.

## Project API Configuration
- **API Style**: RESTful
- **Primary Language**: Python
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Based on standard security
- **Domain Standards**: [INSERT_software-development_STANDARDS]

## RESTful Best Practices

### For software-development Domain
Applying [INSERT_software-development_STANDARDS] which includes:
- Industry-specific data models
- Compliance requirements
- Performance expectations
- Security protocols

### RESTful Patterns
Based on your choice of RESTful:
- Schema design principles
- Error handling standards
- Versioning strategy
- Documentation format

## Integration Points

### With Python
- Framework-specific patterns
- Library integrations
- Middleware configuration
- Performance optimizations

### With PostgreSQL
- Query optimization
- Data modeling
- Transaction handling
- Caching strategy

## Security Level: standard

Your standard security requirements mandate:
- Authentication methods
- Authorization patterns
- Data encryption
- Audit logging
- Rate limiting

## Testing with pytest

API tests will use pytest:
- Unit test patterns
- Integration test setup
- Contract testing
- Load testing approach

## Deployment to Cloud Server

Considering Cloud Server requirements:
- Scaling configuration
- Monitoring setup
- Health checks
- Service discovery
