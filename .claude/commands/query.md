# Query Command

Research and analysis command for understanding codebases and requirements.

## Instructions

Execute comprehensive research and analysis for: $ARGUMENTS

1. **Research Planning**: Define what needs to be understood and analyzed.

2. **Codebase Analysis**: Use parallel file operations to efficiently analyze relevant code.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify existing patterns, architecture, and design decisions.

4. **Requirement Analysis**: Understand constraints, dependencies, and integration points.

5. **Documentation**: Provide clear findings and recommendations.

## Research Techniques

- Parallel file reading for efficiency
