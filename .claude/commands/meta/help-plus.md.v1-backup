2. Use Find & Replace in your editor to replace them
3. Run `/validate-adaptation` to verify fixes

### 2. Permission Errors üîí
**Symptoms**: "Permission denied" or file access errors
**Solution**:
1. Check `.claude/settings.json` allowedPaths configuration
2. Ensure files are in allowed directories
3. Verify file permissions (readable/writable)

### 3. Validation Failures ‚ùå
**Symptoms**: `/validate-adaptation` shows failures
**Solution**:
1. Check specific validation error messages
2. Fix issues one at a time
3. Re-run validation after each fix
4. Use `/help-plus error validation` for specific guidance

### 4. Setup Issues üîß
**Symptoms**: Commands not found, setup script failures
**Solution**:

3. Verify setup script ran without errors
4. Use `/welcome` to restart onboarding process

### 5. Customization Confusion ü§î
**Symptoms**: Unsure how to customize templates
