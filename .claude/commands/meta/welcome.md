- **Advanced**: Experienced with Claude Code and template customization â†’ Choose component assembly

## Beginner Path ðŸŒ± (Layer 1: Auto-Generation)

**Enhanced for v2.0 with validation and error handling**

If you're new to Claude Code template libraries:

### Pre-Setup Validation:
```bash
# Run this first to validate your environment:
/welcome validate
```

### Guided Setup Process:
1. **Environment Check**: Automatic Claude Code environment validation
2. **Auto-Setup**: `/quick-command` for instant template generation (30-second success)
3. **Learn the Basics**: Guided walkthrough of `README.md` installation methods
4. **First Steps with Validation**: 
   - Automated Method 1 (Git Submodule) detection and setup
   - Built-in setup script validation and error recovery
   - Interactive `/help` exploration with usage examples
5. **Progress Tracking**: Automatic todo list creation for your onboarding journey

### Enhanced Features:
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in troubleshooting for common setup issues
- **Progress Validation**: Each step validates before proceeding to next
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects your project type and suggests appropriate templates

**Key Concept**: This is a template library with intelligent auto-generation, not ready-to-use commands. The v2.0 system guides you through customization with validation at each step.

## Intermediate Path ðŸš€ (Layer 2: Guided Customization)

**Enhanced for v2.0 with smart option filtering and validation**

If you're familiar with Claude Code:

### Streamlined Workflow:
1. **Smart Setup**: `/build-command` with guided customization (5-minute success target)
2. **Intelligent Discovery**: Enhanced `/find-commands [category]` with smart filtering (shows only 3-5 relevant options)
3. **Context-Aware Customization**: `/replace-placeholders` with project type detection
4. **Automated Validation**: `/validate-adaptation` with comprehensive error checking and recovery
5. **Progress Integration**: Seamless integration with todo tracking and validation workflow

### v2.0 Enhanced Features:
- **Smart Option Filtering**: System shows only relevant options based on your project context
- **Validation at Each Step**: Built-in validation prevents configuration errors
- **Error Prevention**: Proactive detection of common configuration mistakes
- **Natural Escalation**: Easy upgrade path to Layer 3 (Advanced) when needed
- **De-escalation Support**: Can drop back to Layer 1 (Auto-Generation) if complexity becomes overwhelming

### Workflow Validation:
```bash
# Enhanced validation throughout the process:
/welcome validate           # Environment check
/build-command validate     # Configuration validation  
/validate-adaptation        # Final setup validation
```

**Pro Tip**: The v2.0 `/adapt-to-project` workflow now includes intelligent guidance with automatic error detection and recovery suggestions.

## Advanced Path âš¡ (Layer 3: Professional Component Assembly)

**Enhanced for v2.0 with enterprise-grade assembly and validation**

If you're experienced with template customization:

### Professional Assembly Workflow:
