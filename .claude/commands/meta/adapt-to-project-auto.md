# TRUE Automated Project Adaptation

**This command actually performs automation - no manual work required.**

## What This Does (REAL AUTOMATION)

I will automatically:
1. **Scan your project** using framework detection
2. **Analyze file structure** and dependencies  
3. **Replace ALL placeholders** with detected values
4. **Remove irrelevant commands** for your tech stack
5. **Generate missing commands** using meta-prompting
6. **Validate everything works** with your project

**Time: 2-5 minutes. No manual editing required.**

## Automated Detection & Replacement

### Framework Detection
I'll automatically scan for and detect:
```bash
# JavaScript/Node.js Projects
package.json → Extract name, dependencies, scripts
tsconfig.json → TypeScript configuration
next.config.js → Next.js detection
webpack.config.js → Build tool detection

# Python Projects  
requirements.txt → Dependencies and frameworks
setup.py → Package configuration
manage.py → Django framework detection
pyproject.toml → Modern Python packaging

# Other Languages
pom.xml, build.gradle → Java frameworks
go.mod → Go modules and dependencies
Cargo.toml → Rust projects
composer.json → PHP frameworks
```

### Automatic Placeholder Replacement
Based on detection, I'll replace:
```javascript
// From your package.json or project files
lusaka → "your-actual-project-name"
[INSERT_DESCRIPTION] → "your project description"
[INSERT_AUTHOR] → "Your Name" (from git config)
[INSERT_VERSION] → "1.0.0" (from package.json)

// From framework detection
Python → "React + TypeScript + Node.js"
Python → "JavaScript"
[INSERT_FRAMEWORK] → "React"
pytest → "Jest" 
make → "Webpack"

// From project structure analysis
[INSERT_SRC_DIR] → "src" (detected from file structure)
[INSERT_TEST_DIR] → "tests" or "__tests__"
[INSERT_BUILD_DIR] → "dist" or "build"
```

### Intelligent Template Filtering
I'll automatically:
- **Keep relevant commands** for your tech stack
- **Remove unused commands** (e.g., mobile templates for web projects)
- **Add missing commands** using meta-prompting
- **Update file paths** to match your project structure

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Analysis (30 seconds)
```
🔍 Scanning project structure...
📊 Analyzing package.json/requirements.txt...
🎯 Detecting frameworks: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL
📁 Mapping file structure: src/, tests/, public/
```

### Phase 2: Automation (60-120 seconds)
```
🔄 Replacing placeholders in 64 command templates...
✂️ Removing 15 irrelevant commands for web development...
➕ Generating 3 missing commands for React/Node.js...
🔧 Updating file paths and imports...
```

### Phase 3: Validation (30 seconds)
```
✅ Validating YAML frontmatter in all commands...
🧪 Testing commands against project structure...
📋 Generating project-specific documentation...
🎉 Adaptation complete! All commands ready to use.
```

## What You Get

### Immediately Working Commands
All commands will work without any manual editing:
```bash
/help → Shows YOUR project's command list
/task "add user authentication" → Uses YOUR tech stack
/api-create User → Creates endpoint in YOUR project structure
/test-generate src/auth.js → Generates tests with YOUR testing framework
/deploy-staging → Uses YOUR deployment configuration
```

### Project-Specific Customization
Commands automatically adapt to:
- **Your file structure** (src/, lib/, components/, etc.)
- **Your naming conventions** (camelCase, kebab-case, etc.)
- **Your tech stack** (React vs Vue, Jest vs Mocha, etc.)
- **Your deployment setup** (AWS, Heroku, Docker, etc.)

### Generated Documentation
I'll create:
- **CLAUDE.md** with your project context
- **Command reference** with your specific examples
- **Integration guide** for your team
- **Validation report** showing what was adapted

## Usage Options

### Default (Interactive Confirmation)
```
/adapt-to-project-auto
```
I'll show you what I detected and ask for confirmation before making changes.

### Auto-Confirm (Fully Automated)
```
/adapt-to-project-auto --confirm
```
I'll automatically apply all detected changes without asking.

### Dry Run (Preview Only)
```
/adapt-to-project-auto --dry-run
```
I'll show you exactly what would be changed without making any modifications.

## Example Automation Session

```
👤 /adapt-to-project-auto

🔍 Analyzing project...
📊 Detected: React + TypeScript + Node.js + PostgreSQL
📁 Structure: src/, components/, tests/, public/
📝 Project: "awesome-todo-app" by "John Doe"

🎯 Automation Plan:
  ✅ Replace 47 placeholders across 64 commands
  ✅ Remove 12 commands (mobile, Python, Java templates)
  ✅ Generate 4 new commands (React component, TypeScript utils)
  ✅ Update 23 file path references

Continue with automation? (y/n) y

🔄 Executing automation...
  ✅ Placeholders replaced (2.3s)
  ✅ Irrelevant commands removed (0.8s)  
  ✅ New commands generated (15.4s)
  ✅ Validation completed (1.2s)

🎉 Automation Complete!
  📋 52 commands ready to use
  🎯 100% success rate on validation tests
  ⚡ Try: /help to see your customized commands

Next steps: Test with /task "add user login" or /help api
```

## Verification & Safety

### Backup Protection
Before making changes, I'll automatically:
- Create `.claude.backup` with original templates
- Log all changes in `adaptation-log.md`
- Validate backups can be restored

### Quality Assurance  
Every adapted command is:
- **Syntax validated** (YAML frontmatter, markdown structure)
- **Logic tested** (placeholder replacement verification)
- **Project tested** (commands work with your file structure)
- **Team ready** (consistent with your development patterns)

### Recovery Options
If anything goes wrong:
```
/restore-templates → Restore from .claude.backup
/validate-adaptation → Check current template status
/fix-adaptation → Repair any broken templates
```
