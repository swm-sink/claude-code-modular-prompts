# Create Implementation Plan

I'll create a detailed plan for implementing your feature.

## Planning Process

1. **Analyze Requirements**
   - Understand what needs to be built
   - Identify dependencies and constraints
   - Research similar implementations

2. **Design Approach**
   - Choose appropriate patterns
   - Select tools and libraries
   - Plan data flow and architecture

3. **Break Down Tasks**
   - Create logical implementation steps
   - Identify what can be parallelized
   - Estimate complexity and effort

4. **Define Success**
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Testing strategy
   - Performance requirements

## Your Plan Will Include

- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Risk areas and mitigation
- Testing approach
- Estimated timeline
