# Project Initialization

I'll help you set up a new project or initialize a feature in your existing codebase.

## What to Initialize

**New Project**: Complete project setup with structure, configs, and starter files
**New Feature**: Feature scaffolding within existing project
**Development Environment**: Local dev setup with necessary configs

## Setup Process

1. **Assess Current State** - Check existing structure and conventions
2. **Determine Requirements** - Framework, tools, and patterns to use
3. **Create Structure** - Directories, key files, and configuration
4. **Initialize Tools** - Package management, git, testing framework
5. **Provide Next Steps** - Clear guidance for immediate next actions

## Common Initializations

- **Web App**: React, Vue, or vanilla JS projects
- **Backend API**: Node.js, Python, or other server setup
- **Library/Package**: Reusable component with proper exports
- **Feature Module**: Adding new functionality to existing codebase

What would you like to initialize? I'll create the appropriate structure and files.
