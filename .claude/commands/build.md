# Build Feature

I'll implement your feature following your existing patterns and TDD principles.

## Planning Phase

First, let me understand:
1. **Read existing code** to identify patterns and conventions
2. **Assess scope** - single file edit vs. multi-component feature
3. **Check dependencies** - what files/systems will be affected

## Implementation Strategy

**For simple changes**: Direct implementation following existing patterns
**For complex features**: Break into smaller components with tests
**For new functionality**: Create minimal viable implementation first

## TDD Process

1. **Write failing test** that defines expected behavior
2. **Implement minimal code** to make the test pass
3. **Refactor** to improve design while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat** for each requirement

## Ready to Build

What would you like me to build? I'll analyze your codebase and implement it properly.
