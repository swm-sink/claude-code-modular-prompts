# Quick Project Setup

I'll quickly set up Conductor Commands for your project.

## What I'll Do

1. **Detect Your Stack**
   - Check for package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.
   - Identify your main framework and tools

2. **Create Basic Structure**
   - Set up `.claude/commands/` if needed
   - Create a starter CLAUDE.md for your project

3. **Generate Helper Commands**
   - Create a few commands specific to your tech stack
   - Add common workflow commands you'll need

## Quick Setup Process

This takes about 2 minutes and gives you:
- Project-aware CLAUDE.md
- Basic commands for your workflow
- Ready-to-use Claude Code setup

Let me scan your project and set things up...
