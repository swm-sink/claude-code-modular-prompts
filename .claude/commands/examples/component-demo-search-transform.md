# Search & Transform Demo - Highest Performance Pattern

*This command demonstrates our highest-scoring pattern (154.5%)*

## Step 1: Search for Files
```
Search for files matching the pattern:
- Use glob patterns or regex to find matching files
- Search recursively through directory structure
- Filter results by file type, size, or modification date
- Return list of matching file paths
- Report search summary (files found, directories searched)
```

## Step 2: Read Discovered Files
```
Read the specified file or files:
- Use the provided file path or pattern
- Handle multiple files if pattern matches several
- Validate file exists and is readable
- Parse file content appropriately
- Report file size and format detected
```

## Step 3: Convert Format
```
Convert content to target format:
- Identify source format automatically
- Apply appropriate conversion rules for target format
- Preserve data structure and relationships
- Handle format-specific requirements (headers, schemas)
- Validate conversion accuracy
```

## Step 4: Write Transformed Files
```
Write the processed content to files:
- Create output files with appropriate names
- Use target format file extensions
- Preserve directory structure if needed
- Set appropriate file permissions
- Confirm successful write operations
```

**Pattern Score: 154.5% (Highest Performance)**  
**Components Used: 4 (search-files, file-reader, format-converter, file-writer)**
