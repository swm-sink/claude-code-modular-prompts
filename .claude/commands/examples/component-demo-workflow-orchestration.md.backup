# Workflow Orchestration Demo - Complex Multi-Step Process

*This command demonstrates complex workflow management (130.8% score)*

## Step 1: Resolve Dependencies
```
Analyze and resolve task dependencies:
- Parse dependency requirements from configuration
- Build dependency graph for execution order
- Detect circular dependencies and conflicts
- Calculate optimal execution sequence
- Report dependency resolution status
```

## Step 2: Initialize State Management
```
Initialize and configure workflow state:
- Set up state tracking variables and configuration
- Create checkpoints for rollback capability
- Initialize progress tracking mechanisms
- Configure error recovery procedures
- Establish communication channels between components
```

## Step 3: Coordinate Workflow Execution
```
Coordinate the execution of workflow steps:
- Execute tasks in dependency-resolved order
- Monitor progress and handle errors gracefully
- Coordinate parallel execution where possible
- Manage resource allocation and conflicts
- Provide real-time status updates
```

## Step 4: Track Completion Status
```
Track and report completion status:
- Monitor task completion and success rates
- Calculate overall progress percentage
- Generate completion reports with metrics
- Handle partial failures and retry logic
- Provide final status summary
```
