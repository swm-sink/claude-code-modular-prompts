# Development Workflow Demo - Complete Development Cycle

*This command demonstrates development operations with git, testing, and progress tracking*

## Step 1: Validate User Input
```
Validate the provided input:
- Check for required parameters (branch_name, test_suite)
- Verify branch_name follows naming conventions
- Validate test_suite exists and is executable
- Return clear error messages if validation fails
- Continue only with valid inputs
```

## Step 2: Execute Git Operations
```
Execute git commands safely:
- Check repository status and current branch
- Create or switch to specified branch
- Handle merge conflicts and repository state
- Commit changes with appropriate messages
- Push changes to remote repository if needed
```

## Step 3: Run Tests and Collect Results
```
Run tests and collect results:
- Execute test commands with appropriate parameters
- Capture test output, results, and coverage data
- Handle test failures and error conditions
- Generate test reports and summaries
- Return structured test results for further processing
```

## Step 4: Show Progress Information
```
Display progress and status information:
- Show current step and overall progress percentage
- Display time estimates and completion status
- Provide clear status messages for each operation
- Update progress indicators during long-running tasks
- Include error states and recovery suggestions
```

## Step 5: Ask for User Confirmation
```
Present confirmation prompt to user:
- Display clear summary of proposed actions
- Ask user to confirm before proceeding with critical operations
- Accept various confirmation formats (y/n, yes/no, etc.)
- Handle timeout and default responses appropriately
- Proceed only with explicit user approval
```

## Step 6: Summarize Completed Work
```
Generate comprehensive summary report:
- List all completed tasks and their outcomes
- Include metrics, timing, and success rates
- Highlight any issues or recommendations
- Provide next steps or follow-up actions
- Format summary for easy reading and sharing
```
