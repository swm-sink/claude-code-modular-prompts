# Intelligent Project Orchestration

I'll perform comprehensive parallel analysis using Tree of Thought to create the perfect Claude Code setup for your project.

## Tree of Thought Analysis (Parallel Execution)

**Branch 1: Technical Stack Analysis** (Task agent)
- Detect languages, frameworks, build tools
- Analyze dependency graphs and versions
- Identify architectural patterns (MVC, microservices, etc.)
- WebSearch for latest best practices for each technology

**Branch 2: Codebase Intelligence** (Task agent)
- Calculate complexity metrics (cyclomatic, cognitive)
- Map module dependencies and coupling
- Identify hot spots and technical debt
- Discover testing patterns and coverage

**Branch 3: Workflow Discovery** (Task agent)
- Analyze git history for development patterns
- Detect CI/CD configurations
- Identify team conventions from existing code
- Research industry standards for your domain

**Branch 4: Context Optimization** (Task agent)
- Determine critical paths in codebase
- Identify frequently modified areas
- Map knowledge dependencies
- Create optimal CLAUDE.md structure

## Synthesis Phase (Convergence)

After parallel analysis, I'll synthesize findings to:

1. **Create Precision Commands**
   - Commands that understand YOUR specific patterns
   - Pre-configured with your conventions
   - Optimized for your tech stack

2. **Generate Adaptive Configuration**
   - Dynamic settings.json based on project size
   - Security rules tailored to your needs
   - Performance tuning for your scale

3. **Build Knowledge Base**
   - Comprehensive CLAUDE.md with deep insights
   - Architecture decision records
   - Team-specific conventions

## Extended Thinking Mode

For complex projects, I'll engage extended thinking to:
- Explore multiple configuration strategies
- Evaluate trade-offs between approaches
- Predict future scaling needs
- Consider edge cases and failure modes
