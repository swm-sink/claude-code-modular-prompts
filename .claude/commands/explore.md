# Explore Command

## What I'll Do

I'll explore your project to understand its structure, patterns, and architecture using:
1. File structure analysis
2. Dependency patterns
3. Code organization
4. Framework detection
5. External research validation

## Areas I Can Explore

- **architecture**: Project structure and design patterns
- **testing**: Test coverage and approach
- **dependencies**: Package relationships
- **patterns**: Code patterns and conventions
- **security**: Potential vulnerabilities
- **performance**: Optimization opportunities

## My Approach

1. **Scan** - Use Glob to find relevant files
2. **Analyze** - Use Grep for patterns and Read for details
3. **Research** - Use WebSearch to validate findings
4. **Report** - Provide actionable insights

## Output

You'll receive:
- Project structure overview
- Key patterns identified
- Framework/library usage
- Recommendations based on research
- Potential improvements

Just tell me what area you'd like me to explore, or I'll do a comprehensive analysis.
