# /init-custom - Auto-Configure Framework for Existing Projects

Analyzes your existing codebase and automatically generates PROJECT_CONFIG.xml with appropriate settings.

## Usage
```
/init-custom
```

## What It Does

This command helps you integrate the framework into an existing project by:

1. **Analyzing Your Codebase**
   - Detects programming languages, frameworks, and libraries
   - Identifies project structure and conventions
   - Discovers existing quality standards and testing approaches
   - Maps architectural patterns and domain characteristics

2. **Auto-Generating Configuration**
   - Creates PROJECT_CONFIG.xml with detected settings
   - Selects appropriate framework modules for your tech stack
   - Configures quality gates based on existing standards
   - Sets up development workflows matching your patterns

3. **Framework Customization**
   - Adapts all framework modules to your project specifics
   - Configures domain-specific features and standards
   - Optimizes for your development workflow
   - Ensures zero manual configuration required

## Process

I'll analyze your project using these steps:

1. **Comprehensive Codebase Analysis**
   - Scale and complexity assessment
   - Technology stack detection
   - Architecture pattern recognition
   - Domain identification
   - Convention discovery

2. **Intelligent Module Selection**
   - Choose relevant framework modules
   - Apply domain-specific templates
   - Match quality standards to your needs
   - Optimize workflow configurations

3. **Configuration Generation**
   - Generate complete PROJECT_CONFIG.xml
   - Validate all settings and paths
   - Test framework integration
   - Provide customization report

## Example Workflow

When you run `/init-custom`, I will:
- Scan your project structure
- Analyze code patterns and conventions
- Detect your tech stack (React, Python, Go, etc.)
- Identify testing frameworks and coverage
- Generate PROJECT_CONFIG.xml automatically
- Configure framework for your specific needs

The result is a fully configured framework that adapts to YOUR project, not the other way around!

## Requirements

- Existing codebase with some structure
- At least basic project organization
- Some code files to analyze
