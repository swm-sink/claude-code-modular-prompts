# Discover Command

## What I'll Do

I'll discover your project's unique patterns, conventions, and "DNA" by:
1. Analyzing code structure
2. Identifying naming conventions
3. Finding architectural patterns
4. Detecting testing approaches
5. Understanding workflow patterns

## What I'll Discover

- **Architecture**: Design patterns and structure
- **Conventions**: Naming, formatting, organization
- **Dependencies**: Key libraries and frameworks
- **Testing**: Test patterns and coverage
- **Workflow**: Development processes
- **Anti-patterns**: Issues to avoid

## My Process

1. **Scan** - Comprehensive file analysis
2. **Pattern Match** - Identify recurring patterns
3. **Research** - Validate with best practices
4. **Document** - Create PROJECT-DNA.md
5. **Recommend** - Suggest improvements

## Output

I'll create a PROJECT-DNA.md file containing:
- Core patterns and conventions
- Architecture decisions
- Testing strategies
- Workflow patterns
- Team practices

This becomes your project's reference guide for consistency.
