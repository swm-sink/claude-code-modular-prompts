## Instructions

Execute workflow orchestration for: $ARGUMENTS

1. **Workflow Analysis**: Analyze requirements and select optimal orchestration pattern.
   - **Atomic Checkpoint**: `git add -A && git commit -m "CHAIN ANALYSIS: [workflow_id] - pattern selected and requirements analyzed"`

2. **Environment Preparation**: Initialize context, allocate resources, establish safety mechanisms.
   - **Atomic Checkpoint**: `git add -A && git commit -m "CHAIN SETUP: [workflow_id] - environment prepared with resource allocation"`

3. **Workflow Execution**: Execute commands with coordination, state management, and quality enforcement.
   - **Atomic Checkpoint**: `git add -A && git commit -m "CHAIN EXECUTE: [workflow_id] - workflow executed with [pattern] coordination"`

4. **Results Integration**: Consolidate results, validate compliance, preserve artifacts.
   - **Final Checkpoint**: `git add -A && git commit -m "CHAIN COMPLETE: [workflow_id] - workflow successful with quality validation"`

## Workflow Patterns

### Sequential Pattern
```bash
/chain sequential --commands="/query,/feature,/task" --target="user authentication system"
```
- Commands execute in strict order
- State passed between commands
- Quality gates at each boundary

### Parallel Pattern
```bash
/chain parallel --commands="/task,/task,/task" --coordination="/swarm" --scope="e-commerce components"
```
- Independent commands execute simultaneously
- Shared context and resource coordination
- Result synchronization at completion

### Conditional Pattern
```bash
/chain conditional --start="/auto" --routing="complexity_based" --target="adaptive development"
```
- Dynamic command selection based on conditions
- Intelligent routing based on analysis results
- Context adaptation for optimal outcomes

### Iterative Pattern
```bash
/chain iterative --command="/task" --criteria="quality_threshold_90" --max_iterations="3"
```
- Commands repeat until criteria met
- Progressive improvement with each iteration
- Convergence monitoring and early termination

## Advanced Orchestration Features

### State Management
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain workflow state across command boundaries
- **State Transfer**: Pass data between commands with standardized interfaces
- **Atomic Safety**: Rollback capabilities at workflow and command levels
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Ensure state consistency across parallel execution

### Error Recovery
- **Intelligent Retry**: Adaptive retry strategies based on error type
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue execution with reduced scope when possible
- **Alternative Routing**: Route around failed components using alternative paths
- **Emergency Rollback**: Complete workflow rollback for critical failures

### Performance Optimization
- **Parallel Execution**: Optimize command execution with intelligent parallelization
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamic resource allocation based on workflow needs
- **Context Optimization**: Efficient context management and compression
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute workload optimally across available resources

### Quality Integration
- **Workflow Quality Gates**: Quality enforcement at workflow level
- **Command Quality Gates**: Quality validation at individual command level
- **Cumulative Validation**: Quality validation across complete workflow
- **Compliance Reporting**: Comprehensive compliance documentation
