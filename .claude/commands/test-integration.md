# Create Integration Tests

I'll create integration tests that verify your components work together correctly.

## Testing Approach

1. **Identify Integration Points**
   - API endpoints to test
   - Database interactions
   - Service communications
   - External dependencies

2. **Write Integration Tests**
   - Test data flow between components
   - Verify error handling across boundaries
   - Check transaction integrity
   - Test configuration and setup

3. **Follow Best Practices**
   - Use test fixtures for data
   - Mock external services appropriately
   - Clean up after tests
   - Make tests independent

## What You'll Get

Integration tests that:
- Verify components work together
- Catch integration issues early
- Use appropriate test data
- Run reliably in CI/CD
