# Implement Feature

I'll implement your feature following TDD and best practices.

## Implementation Process

1. **Understand Requirements**
   - Read relevant existing code
   - Identify integration points
   - Research best practices for your stack

2. **Write Tests First (TDD)**
   - Create failing tests for the feature
   - Cover main functionality and edge cases
   - Ensure tests are clear and maintainable

3. **Implement Solution**
   - Write minimal code to pass tests
   - Follow existing code patterns
   - Keep it simple and readable

4. **Refactor & Polish**
   - Improve code structure
   - Add necessary documentation
   - Ensure code meets standards

## What You'll Get

- Working, tested implementation
- Clean, maintainable code
- Tests that document behavior
- Code that fits your project style

Let's build your feature...
