# Debug Issue

I'll analyze and fix the issue using an approach appropriate to its complexity.

## Investigation Process

1. **Understand the error** - Read error messages, logs, or code location
2. **Identify the cause** - Trace through code and dependencies
3. **Find the solution** - Research if needed, apply appropriate fix
4. **Verify the fix** - Test that the issue is resolved

## Adaptive Approach

**Simple issues** (syntax, typos): Quick fix with immediate solution
**Logic bugs**: Step-by-step analysis to find root cause  
**Complex issues**: Deep investigation with research and testing
