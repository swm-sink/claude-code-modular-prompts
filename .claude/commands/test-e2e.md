# Create End-to-End Tests

I'll create E2E tests that validate complete user workflows in your application.

## E2E Testing Strategy

1. **Identify User Journeys**
   - Critical user paths
   - Common workflows
   - Edge cases and error flows

2. **Write E2E Tests**
   - Test from user's perspective
   - Cover full workflow start to finish
   - Verify UI interactions and responses
   - Check data persistence

3. **Use Modern Tools**
   - Search for best E2E framework for your stack
   - Implement page object patterns
   - Add proper waits and retries
   - Generate clear test reports

## What You'll Get

E2E tests that:
- Validate complete user workflows
- Catch user-facing issues
- Run in CI/CD pipeline
- Provide confidence in releases
