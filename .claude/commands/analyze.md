# Project Analysis

I'll analyze your codebase to provide actionable insights.

## Analysis Scope

**Target**: [target or entire project]
**Focus**: [specific area or comprehensive]

## Analysis Process

1. **Project Structure** - Directory organization, file counts, patterns
2. **Code Quality** - Complexity, maintainability, anti-patterns
3. **Dependencies** - External packages, internal coupling
4. **Test Coverage** - Existing tests, coverage gaps
5. **Performance** - Potential bottlenecks, optimization opportunities

## Deliverables

- **Executive Summary**: Key findings and priorities
- **Detailed Findings**: Specific issues with locations
- **Recommendations**: Actionable next steps
- **Metrics**: Quantified assessment where possible

## Getting Started

What would you like me to analyze? I can examine:
- Entire codebase structure and quality
- Specific files or directories  
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Architecture patterns
