# /init-research - Research-Driven Framework Configuration

Configures the framework based on current best practices for your specific domain and tech stack.

## Usage
```
/init-research
```

## What It Does

This command researches and applies the latest best practices:

1. **Domain Research**
   - Searches for current best practices in your domain
   - Identifies industry standards and patterns
   - Discovers recommended tools and workflows
   - Finds proven architectural approaches

2. **Evidence-Based Configuration**
   - Applies research findings to framework setup
   - Configures based on 2025 best practices
   - Implements recommended quality standards
   - Sets up optimal development workflows

3. **Custom Optimization**
   - Tailors framework to your specific needs
   - Incorporates cutting-edge techniques
   - Optimizes for your domain requirements
   - Ensures future-proof configuration

## Research Process

I'll conduct research on:

1. **Industry Best Practices**
   - "{domain} best practices 2025"
   - "{tech-stack} development patterns"
   - "{domain} quality standards"
   - "{framework} optimization techniques"

2. **Architecture Patterns**
   - Scalability approaches for your domain
   - Security requirements and standards
   - Performance optimization strategies
   - Testing methodologies

3. **Tool Ecosystems**
   - Recommended development tools
   - CI/CD best practices
   - Monitoring and observability
   - Developer experience optimization

## Example Research Areas

**For Web Development:**
- React/Vue/Angular best practices
- Performance optimization techniques
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 3.0)
- Security headers and CSP policies

**For Data Science:**
- MLOps best practices
- Reproducibility standards
- Model validation approaches
- Data pipeline patterns

**For Mobile Development:**
- Platform-specific guidelines
