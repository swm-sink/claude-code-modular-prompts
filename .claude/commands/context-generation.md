# Generate Project Context

I'll create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file that helps me understand your project better.

## What I'll Document

1. **Project Overview**
   - What your project does
   - Key technologies and frameworks
   - Architecture patterns

2. **Important Conventions**
   - Coding standards I detect
   - Naming patterns
   - File organization rules

3. **Critical Information**
   - Key business logic locations
   - Important configuration files
   - Database schema insights

4. **Team Patterns**
   - Git workflow conventions
   - Testing approaches
   - Documentation style

## How I'll Build It

1. Scan your project structure with `Glob`
2. Read key files to understand patterns
3. Search for best practices for your tech stack
4. Create a structured CLAUDE.md with all findings

## The Result

A CLAUDE.md file that:
- Helps me give better, project-specific advice
- Documents your unique patterns and conventions
- Reduces repetitive explanations
- Improves my understanding of your codebase
