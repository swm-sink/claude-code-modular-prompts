# Progressive Disclosure System
**Three-Layer Architecture for Claude Code Command Generation**

## System Overview

The Progressive Disclosure System solves the complexity paradox in prompt engineering by providing three distinct layers of interaction, each optimized for different user needs and expertise levels.

### The Complexity Challenge

Traditional approaches fail because they try to serve everyone with one solution:
- **Too Simple**: Power users can't achieve their goals
- **Too Complex**: Casual users are overwhelmed and abandon the system  
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Satisfies no one completely

### Our Solution: Progressive Disclosure

Instead of forcing all users through the same interface, we provide three distinct layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 1: Auto-Generation        80% users, 30-second success│
│ Layer 2: Guided Customization   15% users, 5-minute success │  
│ Layer 3: Component Assembly      5% users, 30-minute success│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Layer 1: Auto-Generation System

### Purpose
**Instant gratification** for users who want results immediately without learning anything.

### Target Users (80% of users)
- First-time users exploring the system
- Users with simple, common tasks
- Users who prefer "magic" over control
- Time-pressed users who need quick solutions

### Command: `/quick-command`

### How It Works
1. **User describes what they want** in natural language
2. **AI determines the command type** (search, analyze, transform, validate, report)
3. **Template system generates working command** with intelligent defaults
4. **Command is immediately ready to use** - no configuration needed

### Example Interaction
```
User: /quick-command "find all TODO comments in JavaScript files"

AI: ✅ Generated /find-todos-in-js (30 seconds)

This command will search for TODO, FIXME, and HACK comments in all 
JavaScript and TypeScript files, showing file names and line numbers.

Ready to use: /find-todos-in-js

Want more control? Try: /build-command search "TODO comments" --customize
```

### Success Criteria
- ✅ **30-second success** from request to working command
- ✅ **Zero learning curve** - no concepts to understand
- ✅ **Intelligent defaults** that work for 80% of cases
- ✅ **Clear upgrade path** to Layer 2 when needed

## Layer 2: Guided Customization System

### Purpose
**Controlled customization** for users who need more than defaults but don't want overwhelming complexity.

### Target Users (15% of users)
- Users who tried Layer 1 but need more control
- Users with specific requirements not met by defaults
- Users willing to spend 5 minutes for better results
- Teams with standard practices to follow

### Command: `/build-command --customize`

### How It Works
1. **Start with auto-generation** using Layer 1 intelligence
2. **Show 3-5 relevant options** based on the user's description
3. **Interactive customization** with previews and explanations
4. **Generate customized command** optimized for their specific needs

### Example Interaction
```
User: /build-command search "security vulnerabilities" --customize

AI: I've generated a security search command. Here are 4 customization options:

🔍 1. Search Patterns [Current: basic keywords]
   • Basic security keywords (current)
   • Advanced vulnerability patterns  
   • Framework-specific patterns

📁 2. File Scope [Current: all code files]
   • All code files (current)
   • Security-critical files only
   • Include configuration files

📊 3. Report Detail [Current: file list]
   • File list with line numbers (current)
   • Detailed context extraction
   • Risk assessment summary

⚙️ 4. Analysis Depth [Current: pattern matching]
   • Pattern matching (current)
   • Static analysis integration
   • Cross-reference checking

Choose options to customize (1,2,3,4): 1,3

✅ Updated with advanced patterns and risk assessment
Generating: /find-security-vulnerabilities-advanced
```

### Success Criteria
- ✅ **5-minute success** from request to customized command
- ✅ **Maximum 5 options** shown at once to prevent decision fatigue
- ✅ **Clear explanations** of what each option does
- ✅ **Preview functionality** before committing to changes
- ✅ **Higher satisfaction** than Layer 1 for specific needs

## Layer 3: Component Assembly System

### Purpose
**Maximum control** for power users who need sophisticated, enterprise-grade workflows.

### Target Users (5% of users)
- Expert developers comfortable with complexity
- Users building reusable, sophisticated automation
- Teams with unique requirements not covered by templates
- Users willing to invest 15-30 minutes for maximum customization

### Command: `/assemble-command`

### How It Works
1. **Component discovery** through interactive browser or templates
2. **Workflow planning** with dependency analysis and compatibility checking
3. **Step-by-step assembly** with real-time validation
4. **Professional-grade features** including testing, performance analysis, security review

### Example Interaction
```
User: /assemble-command --interactive

AI: Welcome to Advanced Component Assembly!

## User Journey & Navigation

### Natural Progression
Users naturally discover higher layers as their needs grow:

```
Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3
 ↓         ↓         ↓
Quick → Guided → Advanced
Magic → Control → Power
```

### Escalation Paths
Each layer suggests the next when appropriate:
- **Layer 1 → Layer 2**: "Want more control? Try `/build-command [type] --customize`"
- **Layer 2 → Layer 3**: "Need maximum flexibility? Try `/assemble-command --interactive`"

### De-escalation Paths  
Users can step back if a layer is too complex:
- **Layer 3 → Layer 2**: "Want something simpler? Try `/build-command [workflow] --customize`"
- **Layer 2 → Layer 1**: "Want quick results? Try `/quick-command [description]`"

- **Extensible framework** - easy to add new components and templates
- **Quality assurance** - comprehensive validation at each layer

## Implementation Philosophy

### Design Principles
1. **Respect user choice** - never force users to a different layer
2. **Optimize for the common case** - Layer 1 serves 80% perfectly
3. **Make complexity optional** - advanced features hidden until needed
4. **Provide clear value** - each layer solves different problems
5. **Enable natural progression** - users discover layers as needs grow

### Anti-Patterns Avoided
- ❌ **One-size-fits-all** - different users have different needs
- ❌ **Feature creep** - adding complexity to simple interfaces
- ❌ **False simplicity** - hiding essential controls from power users
- ❌ **Decision fatigue** - overwhelming users with too many choices
- ❌ **Abandoned complexity** - building features no one uses

The Progressive Disclosure System successfully solves the complexity paradox by acknowledging that different users have fundamentally different needs and providing optimized experiences for each group. Rather than forcing everyone through the same interface, we let users choose their own level of engagement with the system.
