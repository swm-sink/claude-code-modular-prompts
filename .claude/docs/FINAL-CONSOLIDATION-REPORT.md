#### C.2: Archive Maintenance Procedures

**Access Deprecated Commands**
```bash
# View specific deprecated command
cat .claude/commands/deprecated/[command-name].md

# List all deprecated commands
find .claude/commands/deprecated/ -name "*.md" -type f

# Search deprecated commands for specific functionality
grep -r "specific-feature" .claude/commands/deprecated/
```

**Archive Integrity Verification**
```bash
# Verify all deprecated commands have migration paths
python .claude/validation/verify-deprecation-completeness.py

# Validate archive structure consistency
python .claude/validation/validate-archive-structure.py

# Check for missing migration documentation
python .claude/validation/validate-migration-coverage.py
```

**Recovery Procedures**
```bash
# Emergency rollback procedure (not recommended)
# Only use if critical issues discovered with unified commands

# 1. Identify specific consolidation to rollback
git log --oneline --grep="consolidate" | head -10

# 2. Create rollback branch
git checkout -b rollback-[consolidation-name]

# 3. Revert specific consolidation commit
git revert [commit-hash]

# 4. Restore deprecated commands to active directory
mv .claude/commands/deprecated/[command-pattern]*.md .claude/commands/

# 5. Update documentation and notify users
# Note: This should only be done in genuine emergency situations
```
