## Chapter 1: Understanding Prompt Engineering

### What is Systematic Prompt Engineering?

Traditional prompt writing is often ad-hoc and inconsistent. Systematic prompt engineering treats prompts as engineered artifacts that are:
- **Deliberately designed** with clear objectives
- **Systematically tested** against various scenarios
- **Iteratively improved** based on evidence
- **Version controlled** for reproducibility
- **Documented** for team collaboration

### Why Use the /prompt Command?

The `/prompt` command provides:
- **Structured workflows** for creation, evaluation, testing, and improvement
- **Built-in best practices** from proven prompt patterns
- **Objective evaluation metrics** to measure effectiveness
- **Automated testing** against edge cases and scenarios
- **Version management** for tracking improvements

## Chapter 2: Your First Prompt

Let's create your first prompt using the `/prompt` command. We'll build a simple code review assistant.

### Step 1: Create the Initial Prompt

```bash
/prompt create "code_review_assistant" --type system --style directive --framework claude
```

**What this does**:
- Creates a new system prompt named "code_review_assistant"
- Uses directive style (clear, command-like instructions)
- Optimizes for Claude framework
- Applies best practices automatically

**Expected Output**:
```
✓ Prompt created: .claude/prompts/code_review_assistant_v1.0.md
✓ Initial evaluation completed
✓ Test scenarios generated
✓ Documentation created

Next steps:
- Review the generated prompt
- Run evaluation: /prompt evaluate "code_review_assistant_v1.0.md"
- Test with scenarios: /prompt test "code_review_assistant_v1.0.md"
```

### Step 2: Examine the Generated Prompt
