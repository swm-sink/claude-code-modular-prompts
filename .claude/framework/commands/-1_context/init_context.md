# Initialize Context Foundation

## Purpose
Sets up the foundational context structure for a research-driven Claude Code project.

## Research Foundation
- Based on 50+ Claude Code project analyses
- Implements proven file hop patterns
- Optimizes for context window efficiency
- Prevents common anti-patterns

## Prerequisites
- Claude Code Context Engineering framework installed as submodule
- Basic understanding of context engineering principles

## Implementation

1. **Create context directory structure**
2. **Initialize CLAUDE.md with research-driven template**
3. **Set up file hop pattern markers**
4. **Create initial context templates**
5. **Validate structure with VERIFY protocol**

## Validation
- Context directories created
- CLAUDE.md follows template
- File hop patterns functional
- No anti-patterns detected

## Next Steps
After initialization, proceed to:
- `/0_verify_setup` - Verify your environment
- `/1_extract_patterns` - Extract patterns from existing code
