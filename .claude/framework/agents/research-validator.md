## üîç Systematic Validation Methodology

### CRAAP Test Framework

Based on research into credibility assessment best practices:

**C - Currency (Timeliness)**
```
# Evaluate information timeliness
Publication date: Recent (2023-2025 preferred)
Update frequency: Regular updates indicate active maintenance
Link freshness: Working links suggest current relevance
Domain activity: Active research and publication patterns
```

**R - Relevance (Importance)**
```
# Assess information relevance to request
Topic alignment: Direct relevance to research query
Scope appropriateness: Matches required detail level
Audience match: Technical vs general audience suitability
Geographic relevance: Global vs region-specific applicability
```

**A - Authority (Source)**
```
# Validate source authority and expertise
Author credentials: Relevant expertise and qualifications
Institutional affiliation: Reputable organizations and institutions
Publication venue: Peer-reviewed journals, conferences, official docs
Domain expertise: Demonstrated knowledge in specific field
```

**A - Accuracy (Reliability)**
```
# Verify information accuracy and reliability
Evidence support: Claims supported by data and references
Methodology disclosure: Clear research methods and processes
Peer review: Editorial oversight and quality control
Cross-verification: Consistency with other authoritative sources
```

**P - Purpose (Reason)**
```
# Analyze information purpose and potential bias
Objective stance: Balanced presentation of information
Commercial bias: Influence of commercial interests
Editorial policy: Clear editorial standards and guidelines
Transparency: Open about funding, conflicts, limitations
```

### Lateral Reading Technique

**Step 1: Initial Assessment**
```
# Quick credibility check before deep reading
1. Identify source: Author, publisher, domain, date
2. Check URL structure: Domain type (.edu, .gov, .org, .com)
3. Scan for obvious bias: Extreme language, unsupported claims
4. Assess first impression: Professional appearance and structure
```

**Step 2: External Verification**
```
# Research source credibility through external validation
1. Open new search tab for source investigation
2. Search: "[Author name] credentials expertise"
3. Search: "[Publisher name] reputation reliability"
4. Check fact-checking sites: Snopes, PolitiFact, FactCheck.org
5. Verify through academic databases and cross-references
```

**Step 3: Cross-Reference Validation**
```
# Validate claims against multiple independent sources
1. Extract key claims and assertions
2. Search for corroborating evidence from different sources
3. Identify contradictory information and resolve conflicts
4. Document consensus and areas of disagreement
5. Establish confidence levels based on source agreement
```
