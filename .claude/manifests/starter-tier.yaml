# Setup Instructions
setup:
  steps:
    1. "Copy 4 command files to .claude/commands/"
    2. "Copy 12 modules to .claude/modules/"
    3. "Test with: /auto 'Fix a simple bug'"
    4. "Start with /task for focused work"
  
  validation:
    - "All 4 commands work independently"
    - "/auto correctly routes requests"
    - "Commands complete within time limits"
    - "TDD workflow enforced in /task"
