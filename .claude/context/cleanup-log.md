# Cleanup Log

## Session: 2025-07-24

### Changes Made

1. **CLAUDE.md Minimization**
   - Reduced from 170 lines to 35 lines
   - Removed verbose TDD rhetoric
   - Kept only essential structure and metrics
   - Moved details to context files

2. **Context File Creation**
   - Created `.claude/context/` directory
   - Split documentation into focused files:
     - `principles.md` - Core development principles
     - `llm-antipatterns.md` - What NOT to do
     - `development.md` - TDD workflow, quality gates
     - `commands.md` - Command structure and list
     - `agent-orchestration.md` - Agent patterns
     - `cleanup-log.md` - This file

### Pending Cleanup Tasks

1. **Remove .main directory entirely**
   - Contains 171 duplicate commands
   - Excessive nesting (6+ levels)
   - No actual cleanup, just relocation from tallinn/

2. **Command Curation**
   - Reduce from 171 to 50 commands
   - Write tests for each command
   - Ensure <100ms execution

3. **Directory Flattening**
   - Maximum 3 levels of nesting
   - Remove excessive categorization
   - Consolidate duplicate structures

4. **Documentation Reduction**
   - Remove 34 README files
   - Eliminate meta-documentation
   - Keep only essential docs

### Metrics Tracking

| Action | Before | After | Target |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| CLAUDE.md lines | 485→170 | 35 | ✅ |
| Context files | 0 | 6 | ✅ |
| Total MD files | 341 | 341 | <50 |
| Commands | 171 | 171 | 50 |
| Max dir depth | 6+ | 6+ | 3 |

### Lessons Learned

1. **LLMs tend to over-document** - Created verbose CLAUDE.md replacement initially
2. **Simple is better** - 35 lines > 170 lines for master prompt
3. **Context files work** - Better organization, selective loading
4. **Track reality** - Metrics expose the promise vs reality gap
