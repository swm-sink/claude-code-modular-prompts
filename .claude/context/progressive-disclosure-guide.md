# Progressive Disclosure System Guide

## Overview

The Progressive Disclosure System is a three-layer approach to command complexity that allows users to access functionality at their comfort level while providing clear escalation paths.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Principles

### Progressive Complexity
- **Layer 1**: Instant success with zero learning curve (80% of users)
- **Layer 2**: Guided customization with smart options (15% of users)  
- **Layer 3**: Professional assembly with full control (5% of users)

### Natural Navigation
- Clear escalation paths: L1 â†’ L2 â†’ L3
- De-escalation options: L3 â†’ L2 â†’ L1
- Context-aware recommendations

### Success Guarantees
- **Layer 1**: 30-second success target
- **Layer 2**: 5-minute guided success target
- **Layer 3**: 15-30 minute professional success target

## ðŸ“‹ Layer Implementation

### Layer 1: Auto-Generation (`/quick-command`)
**Purpose**: Instant command generation with intelligent defaults

**Features**:
- Template-based auto-generation
- Intelligent context detection
- Zero configuration required
- Immediate functional output

**Integration Points**:
- Context: Reads project patterns automatically
- Components: Uses atomic components with smart defaults
- Escalation: "Want more control? Try `/build-command`"

### Layer 2: Guided Customization (`/build-command`)
**Purpose**: Structured customization with filtered options

**Features**:
- Smart option filtering (3-5 options maximum)
- Interactive configuration
- Preview capabilities
- Validation and guidance

**Integration Points**:
- Context: Leverages Layer 1 foundation
- Components: Configurable atomic + analysis components
- Escalation: "Need full control? Try `/assemble-command`"

### Layer 3: Professional Assembly (`/assemble-command`)
**Purpose**: Component-level assembly for professional workflows

**Features**:
- Full component library access (91 components)
- Assembly templates and compatibility matrix
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Enterprise-grade validation

**Integration Points**:
- Context: Can invoke any layer as needed
- Components: All categories available with compatibility validation
- Escalation: None (highest level)

## ðŸ”„ Layer Integration Patterns

### Command Chaining
```
/quick-command â†’ generates basic command
/build-command [generated-command] --customize â†’ adds guided options
/assemble-command [customized-command] --professional â†’ full assembly
```

### Context Preservation
- Each layer maintains state from previous layers
- User choices are preserved during escalation
- De-escalation maintains essential functionality

### Smart Recommendations
- Usage patterns inform layer suggestions
- Project complexity guides initial layer selection
- User expertise level influences default paths

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Patterns

### Discovery Flow
1. **Entry Point**: `/quick-command` for immediate success
2. **Exploration**: Layer 2 when basic isn't sufficient  
3. **Mastery**: Layer 3 for professional workflows

### Success Metrics
- **Time to First Success**: Layer 1 optimized for 30 seconds
- **Customization Efficiency**: Layer 2 optimized for 5 minutes
- **Professional Productivity**: Layer 3 optimized for complex workflows

### Error Recovery
- Layer failures automatically suggest appropriate layer
- Complexity mismatches guide layer navigation
- Progressive help system matches layer complexity

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Guidelines

### Command Development
- Every command should support at least 2 layers
- Layer boundaries must be clear and documented
- Escalation paths must be explicit and tested

### Component Integration
- Atomic components work across all layers
- Analysis components primarily for Layers 2-3
- Orchestration components primarily for Layer 3

### Context Engineering
- Layer 1: Minimal context requirements
- Layer 2: Moderate context with smart filtering
- Layer 3: Full context access with validation

## ðŸ“Š Success Patterns

### Layer 1 Success Indicators
- Zero learning curve achieved
- Immediate functional output
- High completion rates (>90%)

### Layer 2 Success Indicators  
- Options remain manageable (3-5 max)
- Guided flow completion
- Reduced decision paralysis

### Layer 3 Success Indicators
- Professional workflow efficiency
- Full customization capability
- Enterprise-grade reliability

## ðŸš¨ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Layer Confusion
- Don't mix layer complexities in single command
- Avoid unclear escalation paths
- Never force users into inappropriate layers

### Option Explosion
- Layer 2 must limit options to prevent overwhelm
- Use smart filtering, not comprehensive menus
- Progressive revelation of complexity

### Context Overload
- Layer 1 should work with minimal context
- Don't require expert knowledge for basic functionality
- Scale context requirements with layer complexity

## ðŸ”— Integration with Core Systems

### Template Library Integration
- Templates support all three layers
- Layer-appropriate examples and documentation
- Consistent experience across command types

### Validation Framework Integration
- Layer-appropriate validation complexity
- Progressive error messages
- Context-aware help systems

### Component System Integration
- Atomic components: All layers
- Analysis components: Layers 2-3
- Orchestration components: Layer 3 focus
