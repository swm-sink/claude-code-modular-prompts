# Examples Library

**Purpose**: Comprehensive curated examples library with hierarchical organization, learning paths, and progress tracking for skill development from beginner to expert level.

**Usage**: 
- Provides skill-level progression examples (beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert)
- Organizes examples by domain (web, data science, DevOps, AI/ML, security, cloud)
- Enables context-based discovery with tagging and intelligent search
- Supports interactive learning with runnable code and visual outputs
- Tracks learning progress with analytics, gamification, and professional development

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: meta-learning, component-loader, all command and component categories
- **Requires**: example_categories, skill_levels, progress_tracking, search_index
- **Conflicts**: None (universal learning resource)

**Implementation**:
```yaml
examples_library:
  skill_levels: [beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert]
  domains: [web_dev, data_science, devops, ai_ml, security]
  features: [interactive_code, visual_outputs, progress_tracking]
  discovery: [tag_based, intelligent_search, recommendations]
```

**Category**: learning | **Complexity**: moderate | **Time**: 1-2 days
