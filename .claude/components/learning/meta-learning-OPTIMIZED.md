# Meta-Learning Framework

**Purpose**: Advanced meta-learning using Claude's few-shot capabilities for rapid adaptation, knowledge transfer, and pattern extraction across domains.

**Usage**: 
- Implement "learning how to learn" through pattern recognition and adaptation
- Enable rapid adaptation to new but similar tasks using existing knowledge
- Transfer insights from one domain to another through knowledge mapping
- Build on previous problem-solving experiences for continuous improvement
- Select optimal learning approaches based on problem characteristics

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: examples-library, adaptive-thinking, pattern-extraction, cognitive-architecture
- **Requires**: Problem-solving experiences and pattern recognition capabilities
- **Conflicts**: None (foundational learning enhancement)

**Implementation**:
```python
