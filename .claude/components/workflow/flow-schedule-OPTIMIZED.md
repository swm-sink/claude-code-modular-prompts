# Workflow Scheduling and Orchestration

**Purpose**: Advanced workflow scheduling system managing complex task dependencies, resource allocation, and execution timing with intelligent algorithms and adaptive management.

**Usage**: 
- Maps task dependencies and identifies critical paths
- Implements priority-based scheduling with load balancing
- Monitors real-time execution with adaptive rescheduling
- Optimizes for throughput and latency with pipeline parallelization
- Provides predictive analytics for resource planning

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: task-planning, dependency-analysis, parallel-execution, dag-orchestrator
- **Requires**: task_dependencies, resource_constraints, scheduling_algorithms
- **Conflicts**: None (enhances workflow execution)

**Implementation**:
```yaml
flow_schedule:
  scheduling: [priority_based, load_balanced, deadline_driven]
  execution: real_time_orchestration
  optimization: [throughput, latency, resource_utilization]
  analytics: [performance_metrics, predictive_forecasting]
```

**Category**: workflow | **Complexity**: moderate | **Time**: 1-2 hours
