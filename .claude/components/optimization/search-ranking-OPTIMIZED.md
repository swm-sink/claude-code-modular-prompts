# Search Ranking and Optimization

**Purpose**: Advanced search ranking system optimizing results through intelligent scoring, relevance analysis, personalization, and continuous machine learning improvement.

**Usage**: 
- Applies multi-factor relevance scoring (content, context, quality, user behavior)
- Implements adaptive ML ranking algorithms with personalization
- Combines multiple ranking strategies through ensemble methods
- Monitors performance with A/B testing and feedback integration
- Evolves algorithms based on user satisfaction and engagement metrics

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: codebase-discovery, pattern-extraction, examples-library, all search operations
- **Requires**: search_index, user_behavior_data, ranking_models, feedback_loops
- **Conflicts**: None (enhances all search functionality)

**Implementation**:
```yaml
search_ranking:
  scoring: [content_relevance, contextual_relevance, quality_metrics]
  algorithms: [learning_to_rank, personalization, ensemble_methods]
  optimization: continuous_improvement
  metrics: [relevance, CTR, satisfaction, task_completion]
```

**Category**: optimization | **Complexity**: moderate | **Time**: 1-2 hours
