# Agent Swarm Intelligence

**Purpose**: Coordinate multiple autonomous agents using swarm intelligence principles for distributed problem-solving with emergent behavior and collective decision-making.

**Usage**: 
- Orchestrates decentralized multi-agent systems with self-organization capabilities
- Enables emergent problem-solving through swarm intelligence algorithms
- Facilitates distributed task execution with adaptive coordination protocols
- Supports collective intelligence for complex optimization and discovery tasks
- Provides swarm analytics for performance monitoring and pattern identification

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: task-planning, dependency-analysis, progress-tracking, prompt-optimization
- **Requires**: swarm_size, task_distribution, coordination_protocol, convergence_criteria
- **Conflicts**: quick-command (complexity mismatch), user-confirmation (autonomy conflict)

**Implementation**:
```python
swarm = AgentSwarm(
    agents=10,
    behavior="emergent",
    coordination="decentralized",
    intelligence="collective"
)
swarm.execute_distributed_task(complex_problem)
```
