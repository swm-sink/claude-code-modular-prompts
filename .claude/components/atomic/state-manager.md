# State Manager Component

```
Coordinate command execution state management:
- Initialize state variables from parsed configuration file parameters
- Track workflow progress using timestamped checkpoint files
- Execute atomic state transitions with immediate rollback on errors
- Validate state consistency using checksum verification across operations
- Persist state changes to designated JSON/YAML storage files  
- Generate state reports with detailed error messages and recovery steps
