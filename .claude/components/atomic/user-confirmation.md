# User Confirmation Component

```
Before destructive actions:
- Accept and parse input data or parameters
- Clearly explain what will happen
- List affected files/resources
- Ask "execute you want to proceed?"
- Handle errors and edge cases according to defined criteria
- Wait for explicit confirmation
