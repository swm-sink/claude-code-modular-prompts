# Test Runner Component

**Purpose**: Execute tests with result analysis, coverage reporting, and failure handling for various project types.

**Usage**: 
- Detect project type and run appropriate test commands automatically
- Capture and analyze test output for failures and coverage metrics
- Process test failures with detailed error analysis and suggestions
- Generate comprehensive test summaries with actionable recommendations
- Handle different test frameworks and reporting formats

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: error-handler, output-formatter, task-summary, git-operations
- **Requires**: Project with test configuration and test files
- **Conflicts**: None (universal testing support)

**Implementation**:
```pseudocode
project_type = detect_project_testing_framework()
test_command = get_appropriate_test_command(project_type)
result = execute_tests_and_capture_output(test_command)
analysis = analyze_failures_and_coverage(result)
summary = generate_test_report_with_recommendations(analysis)
return {passed: count, failed: count, coverage: percentage, recommendations: actions}
```
