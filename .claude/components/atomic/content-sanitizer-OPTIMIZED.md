# Content Sanitizer Component

**Purpose**: Remove security risks from user-generated content and external data sources before processing.

**Usage**: 
- Remove potentially harmful code, scripts, and malicious markup
- Escape special characters and HTML/XML elements safely
- Validate content against secure whitelist patterns
- Strip unnecessary metadata and potentially dangerous formatting
- Provide fallbacks for unsupported or dangerous content types

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: input-validation, error-handler, output-formatter, response-validator
- **Requires**: Raw content from various sources
- **Conflicts**: None (universal security component)

**Implementation**:
```pseudocode
content = receive_raw_input()
cleaned = remove_scripts_and_code(content)
escaped = escape_special_characters(cleaned)
validated = check_against_whitelist(escaped)
sanitized = strip_dangerous_metadata(validated)
return {clean_content: sanitized, warnings: security_issues_found}
```
