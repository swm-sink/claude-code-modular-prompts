# Chaos Engineering

**Purpose**: Implement chaos engineering for comprehensive system resilience testing through controlled failure simulation and automated recovery validation.

**Usage**: 
- Simulates infrastructure failures (service termination, network issues, resource exhaustion)
- Tests application-level chaos (command failures, component dependencies, security bypasses)
- Executes hypothesis-driven experiments with measurable success criteria
- Provides automated chaos orchestration with intelligent scheduling
- Validates disaster recovery and business continuity procedures

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: circuit-breaker, error-handler, framework-validation, monitoring systems
- **Requires**: failure_scenarios, recovery_metrics, experiment_scheduler, impact_analyzer
- **Conflicts**: production environments without proper safeguards

**Implementation**:
```yaml
chaos_engineering:
  experiments: [infrastructure_failure, app_chaos, performance_degradation]
  scheduling: intelligent_non_critical_hours
  recovery_validation: automated
  metrics: [MTTR, resilience_score, business_impact]
```
