**Usage**: 
- Establishes democratic constitutional principles through participatory design
- Integrates reinforcement learning from human feedback for value alignment
- Provides multi-dimensional ethical reasoning and harm prevention
- Ensures transparent decision-making with constitutional compliance monitoring
- Enables continuous constitutional evolution through democratic feedback loops

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: safety-framework, harm-prevention-framework, multi-agent-coordination
- **Requires**: stakeholder_engagement, transparency_level, principle_categories
- **Conflicts**: None (enhances all AI safety approaches)

**Implementation**:
```python
constitutional_ai = ConstitutionalFramework(
    approach="democratic_participatory",
    principles=["harm_prevention", "human_dignity", "fairness_justice"],
    rlhf_integration=True,
    transparency="full_explainability"
)
constitutional_ai.implement_ethical_reasoning()
```
