# Constitutional AI Safety Framework

**Purpose**: Comprehensive safety framework implementing constitutional AI principles with multi-layered protection, ethical decision-making, and continuous monitoring for responsible AI behavior.

**Usage**: 
- Provides pre-execution safety assessment and ethical validation
- Enables real-time monitoring during command execution with course correction
- Performs output validation against constitutional principles (harmlessness, helpfulness, honesty, transparency)
- Integrates with all commands and components for consistent safety alignment
- Balances safety constraints with maximum helpfulness and user satisfaction

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: constitutional-framework, harm-prevention-framework, all commands and components
- **Requires**: constitutional_principles, safety_assessment_hooks, monitoring_system
- **Conflicts**: None (universal safety integration)

**Implementation**:
```python
safety_framework = ConstitutionalSafetyFramework(
    principles=["harmlessness", "helpfulness", "honesty", "transparency"],
    monitoring="real_time",
    validation="pre_and_post_execution"
)
safety_framework.apply_constitutional_constraints()
```
