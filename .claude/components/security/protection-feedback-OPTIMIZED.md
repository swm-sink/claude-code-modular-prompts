# Security Protection User Feedback

**Purpose**: Real-time user feedback system showing credential protection status during command execution with visible confirmation of sensitive data masking.

**Usage**: 
- Displays real-time protection status with masked credential count and types
- Provides command protection banners for enhanced security awareness during execution
- Shows progress indicators during command execution phases with security checkpoints
- Generates end-of-command protection summaries with metrics and user security scores
- Integrates with commands handling sensitive data (/secure-assess, /db-migrate, /deploy)

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: credential-protection, command-security-wrapper, harm-prevention-framework, progress-indicator
- **Requires**: credential_detection, security_notifications, protection_metrics
- **Conflicts**: quick-command (complexity mismatch)

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const protectionFeedback = new ProtectionFeedback({
    real_time: true,
    credential_masking: true,
    security_metrics: true
});
protectionFeedback.showProtectionStatus(detectionResult);
```
