# Intelligent Git Merge Management

**Purpose**: Advanced git merge workflow with conflict resolution, strategy optimization, and integration validation for seamless branch integration.

**Usage**: 
- Analyzes branch divergence and identifies potential conflicts
- Selects optimal merge strategy (fast-forward, no-ff, squash, rebase)
- Provides intelligent conflict resolution with automated and manual guidance
- Validates integration with automated testing and quality checks
- Ensures successful merge with comprehensive post-merge verification

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: git-operations, git-commit, all branching workflows
- **Requires**: branch_analysis, conflict_detection, merge_strategy_config
- **Conflicts**: None (enhances git workflow)

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Strategy selection
merge --strategy=recursive --no-ff feature-branch

# Conflict resolution
<<< HEAD (current branch)
=== (divider)
>>> feature-branch (incoming)
```
