# Tree of Thoughts Framework

**Purpose**: Implement Tree of Thoughts reasoning for systematic exploration of multiple solution paths with deliberate branching and comparative evaluation.

**Usage**: 
- Decomposes problems into explorable dimensions
- Generates multiple distinct solution branches
- Evaluates each path with comparative analysis
- Synthesizes best elements from different branches
- Provides practical implementation plans

**Compatibility**: 
- **Works with**: tree-of-thoughts, react-reasoning, pattern-extraction
- **Requires**: problem_statement, branching_strategy, evaluation_criteria
- **Conflicts**: None (enhances reasoning approaches)

**Implementation**:
```yaml
tree_of_thoughts:
  decomposition: explorable_dimensions
  branches: [approach_1, approach_2, approach_3]
  evaluation: comparative_analysis
  synthesis: best_elements_combination
```

**Category**: reasoning | **Complexity**: simple | **Time**: 15 minutes
