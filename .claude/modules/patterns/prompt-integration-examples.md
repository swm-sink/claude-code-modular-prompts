```bash
# Simple prompt creation for straightforward use cases
/prompt create "Bug report template" --type user --style structured

# Task command delegates to prompt engineering for simple tasks
/task "Create a code review checklist prompt" --prompt
```

### Multi-Agent Prompt Evaluation
```bash
# Complex prompt evaluation across multiple expertise domains
/swarm "Comprehensive evaluation of customer support chatbot prompts"

# This triggers multi-agent coordination:
# - Prompt Engineer: Evaluates clarity and specificity metrics
# - Quality Specialist: Assesses robustness and error handling
# - Performance Analyst: Benchmarks effectiveness and response quality
# - Security Specialist: Reviews for potential security issues
```

### Intelligent Routing for Prompt Work
```bash
# Auto command intelligently routes prompt-related requests
/auto "Create and evaluate a comprehensive API documentation generator prompt"

# This automatically:
# 1. Recognizes prompt engineering requirement
# 2. Routes to /prompt for creation
# 3. Escalates to /swarm for comprehensive evaluation
# 4. Integrates quality gates from production standards
```

## Workflow Integration Examples

### TDD for Prompt Engineering
```markdown
## RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Cycle for Prompts

### RED Phase
- Write failing test scenarios that specify expected prompt behavior
- Define edge cases and error conditions
- Create evaluation criteria that currently fail

### GREEN Phase  
- Implement minimal prompt changes to make test scenarios pass
- Focus on basic functionality without optimization
- Ensure all evaluation metrics meet minimum thresholds

### REFACTOR Phase
- Improve prompt clarity and effectiveness while maintaining test success
- Optimize for better performance metrics
- Enhance robustness without breaking existing functionality
```

### Session Management Integration
```bash
# Automatic session creation for complex prompt engineering work
/prompt improve "customer-service-bot.md" --comprehensive --iterations 5

# This automatically creates a prompt engineering session tracking:
# - Version control and iteration management
# - Evaluation metrics progression
# - A/B testing results
# - Improvement documentation
```

### Quality Gates Integration
```yaml
# Production standards apply to prompt engineering
prompt_quality_gates:
  clarity_score: ">= 0.8"
  specificity_score: ">= 0.8" 
  robustness_score: ">= 0.7"
  effectiveness_score: ">= 0.8"
  test_coverage: ">= 90%"
  security_review: "passed"
```

## Command Integration Patterns

### Auto Command Intelligence
```bash
# Auto recognizes prompt engineering needs and routes appropriately

/auto "Our chatbot responses are inconsistent"
# → Routes to /prompt evaluate for assessment

/auto "Need a new system prompt for code generation"  
# → Routes to /prompt create with appropriate parameters

/auto "Evaluate all our AI assistant prompts for security issues"
# → Escalates to /swarm for comprehensive multi-agent evaluation
```

### Task Command Integration
```bash
# Task command includes prompt engineering capabilities

/task "Fix the unclear instructions in our API prompt"
# → Uses prompt improvement workflow with quality gates

/task "Add error handling to documentation generator prompt"
# → Applies TDD methodology to prompt development
```

### Swarm Command Orchestration
```bash
# Swarm coordinates complex prompt engineering projects

/swarm "Optimize our entire AI assistant prompt suite for Claude 4"

# Multi-agent coordination:
# - System Architect: Reviews overall prompt architecture
# - Prompt Engineer: Optimizes individual prompts
# - Security Specialist: Ensures no security vulnerabilities
# - Performance Engineer: Benchmarks and optimizes effectiveness
# - Quality Specialist: Validates against quality standards
```
