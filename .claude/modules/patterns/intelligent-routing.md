      Research and analysis phases use parallel_execution for 70% faster routing decisions
      Pattern matching leverages smart_memoization for &lt;10ms cached lookups
      Command handlers use lazy_loading for 50% faster startup
      Routing decisions follow three_x_rule and consequence_mapping for accuracy
      Complex tasks trigger issue_tracking pattern through session creation
      Request validation uses explicit_validation for clear error messaging
