# Meta Modules

This directory contains meta-framework modules that enable self-improvement, optimization, and governance of the framework itself.

## Overview

Meta modules provide the framework with self-awareness, adaptation capabilities, and continuous improvement mechanisms while maintaining safety boundaries and human oversight.

## Categories

### Framework Management
- **framework-auditor.md** - Comprehensive framework validation and compliance checking
- **update-cycle-manager.md** - Manages framework evolution and update cycles
- **governance-enforcer.md** - Enforces safety boundaries and human oversight

### Optimization
- **continuous-optimizer.md** - Real-time performance and efficiency optimization
- **performance-monitor.md** - Tracks and analyzes framework performance metrics
- **pattern-optimizer.md** - Optimizes pattern usage and composition

### Self-Improvement
- **framework-evolver.md** - Manages framework evolution with safety bounds
- **learning-integrator.md** - Integrates learned patterns and improvements
- **adaptation-engine.md** - Enables context-aware framework adaptation

### Diagnostics
- **compliance-diagnostics.md** - Diagnoses and fixes compliance issues
- **health-monitor.md** - Monitors framework health and stability
- **error-pattern-analyzer.md** - Analyzes error patterns for prevention

### Orchestration
- **meta-orchestrator.md** - Coordinates meta-level operations
- **multi-agent-swarm-orchestrator.md** - Advanced multi-agent coordination
- **meta-command-router.md** - Routes meta-commands to appropriate modules

## Safety Boundaries

All meta modules operate within strict safety boundaries:
- Maximum 5% change per week
- Human approval required for significant changes
- 60-second rollback capability
- 99.9% stability requirement

## Usage

Meta modules are invoked through meta-commands:

```bash
/meta-review      # Audit framework compliance
/meta-evolve      # Propose framework improvements
/meta-optimize    # Optimize performance
/meta-govern      # Enforce governance rules
/meta-fix         # Fix compliance issues
```

## Integration

Meta modules integrate with:
- Core framework components
- Quality gates and validation
- Human oversight mechanisms
- Performance monitoring systems

## Evolution Tracking

All meta-operations are tracked in:
- `.claude/meta/evolution/` - Framework change history
- `.claude/meta/safety/` - Safety validation logs
- `.claude/meta/learning/` - Pattern learning data
