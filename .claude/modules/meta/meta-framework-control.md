## Integration with Framework

This controller module serves as the central routing hub for all meta-framework operations, ensuring:

- **Safety First**: All operations respect safety boundaries and require appropriate user oversight
- **Specialized Routing**: Each operation type routes to the most appropriate specialized module
- **User Control**: Users maintain full control with intervention capabilities and approval gates
- **Operational Integrity**: Framework stability and rollback capabilities are preserved
- **Performance Monitoring**: All operations are tracked with metrics and impact assessment

## Available Meta Operations

- **review**: Comprehensive framework analysis and compliance checking
- **optimize**: Performance improvements and efficiency enhancements  
- **govern**: Safety enforcement and governance policy compliance
- **evolve**: Framework evolution with safety-validated improvements
- **fix**: Issue diagnosis and resolution with compliance restoration
