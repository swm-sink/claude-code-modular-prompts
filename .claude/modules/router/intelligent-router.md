## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Task Routing

**User Input**: "Fix the bug in the login component"

**Router Processing**:
```yaml
complexity_analysis:
  cognitive: 4 (debugging required)
  technical: 3 (single component)
  scope: 2 (focused change)
  uncertainty: 5 (bug not specified)
  overall: 3.5

intent_recognition:
  action: "debug"
  entity: "login component"
  confidence: 0.85

routing_decision:
  command: "/task"
  thinking_mode: "standard"
  confirmation: "guided_disclosure"
```

**Response**:
```
🎯 **Task**: Debug login component issue
📋 **Approach**: Focused debugging with /task
⏱️ **Estimated**: 15-30 minutes

I'll analyze the login component, identify the bug, and implement a fix.
Proceeding with /task...
```

### Example 2: Complex Feature Routing

**User Input**: "I need to implement a new payment system with multiple providers"

**Router Processing**:
```yaml
complexity_analysis:
  cognitive: 7 (architecture decisions)
  technical: 8 (multiple integrations)
  scope: 9 (system-wide impact)
  uncertainty: 6 (requirements unclear)
  overall: 7.5

intent_recognition:
  action: "create"
  entity: "payment system"
  modifiers: ["multiple providers"]
  confidence: 0.92

routing_decision:
  command: "/swarm"
  thinking_mode: "extended"
  confirmation: "comprehensive_disclosure"
```

**Response**:
```
🎯 **Complex Feature Analysis**
- **Intent**: Create comprehensive payment system
- **Complexity**: 7.5/10 (High - Multiple integrations required)
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-4 hours
- **Tools Required**: Architecture design, API integration, testing

📋 **Recommended Approach**:
**Multi-Agent Coordination (/swarm)** - Best for complex, multi-component systems

This will involve:
1. 🏗️ Architecture design and planning
2. 🔌 Multiple payment provider integrations  
3. 🧪 Comprehensive testing strategy
4. 🔒 Security implementation
5. 📚 Documentation and deployment

Shall I proceed with /swarm coordination?
```

### Example 3: Analysis Task Routing

**User Input**: "Help me understand how the authentication system works"

**Router Processing**:
```yaml
complexity_analysis:
  cognitive: 5 (system understanding)
  technical: 4 (existing code analysis)
  scope: 6 (system-wide review)
  uncertainty: 3 (clear request)
  overall: 4.5

intent_recognition:
  action: "analyze"
  entity: "authentication system"
  confidence: 0.95

routing_decision:
  command: "/query"
  thinking_mode: "standard"
  execution: "parallel_file_reading"
```

**Response**:
```
🎯 **Analysis Task**: Authentication system review
📋 **Approach**: Comprehensive analysis with /query
⏱️ **Estimated**: 10-20 minutes

I'll examine the authentication system architecture, identify key components, 
and provide you with a clear overview of how it works.

Proceeding with /query analysis...
