| 1.0.0   | 2025-07-11   | stable |

## Purpose

The SOAR framework provides a structured approach for strategic analysis and planning. SOAR stands for Situation, Objectives, Actions, Results - a framework optimized for strategic thinking, goal-oriented tasks, and systematic problem-solving.

## Framework Structure

```xml
<soar_framework>
  <situation>Analyze current state, context, and environmental factors</situation>
  <objectives>Define clear goals, success criteria, and desired outcomes</objectives>
  <actions>Specify strategic actions and implementation steps</actions>
  <results>Measure outcomes, assess success, and plan next steps</results>
</soar_framework>
```

## Implementation Pattern
