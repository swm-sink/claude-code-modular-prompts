# Agents Commands

High-level, autonomous agents that perform complex, multi-step tasks.

## Available Commands

*   **`/agent dag-orchestrator`**: Orchestrates complex multi-agent workflows using DAG patterns.
*   **`/agent refactorer`**: Autonomous code refactoring agent with architectural improvements.
*   **`/agent researcher`**: Intelligent research agent for gathering and synthesizing information.
*   **`/agent swarm`**: Coordinates multiple specialized agents for parallel task execution.

## Usage Patterns

Agents are designed for complex, multi-step operations that require:
- Planning and strategy
- Autonomous decision making
- Multi-phase execution
- Result synthesis and reporting

## Examples

```bash
# Research a topic comprehensively
/agent researcher "best practices for API design"

# Refactor an entire module
/agent refactorer "modernize authentication system"

# Complex workflow orchestration
/agent swarm "implement user management feature"
```

## Agent Coordination

Agents can work together through:
- Sequential chaining for dependent tasks
- Parallel execution for independent operations
- Hierarchical coordination for complex workflows
