# IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
# =============================================================================
implementation:
  philosophy:
    - "Iterative: Build, test, refine each phase"
    - "User-centric: Regular testing and feedback"
    - "Evidence-based: Validate with research"
    - "Flexible: Adapt based on learnings"
    - "Quality-first: Don't rush, build right"
    
  resource_requirements:
    time: "32 days with 20% buffer"
    testing: "Multiple test projects"
    research: "Access to 20+ repositories"
    validation: "User testers for feedback"
