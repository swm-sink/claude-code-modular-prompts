# Claude Context Architect - PURE CLAUDE CODE NATIVE TRANSFORMATION
# Version: 5.0 - Direct Transformation to Pure Claude Native
# Format: YAML (Single Source of Truth)
# Last Updated: 2025-01-09T22:45:00Z

# =============================================================================
# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PIVOT: PURE CLAUDE CODE NATIVE ARCHITECTURE
# =============================================================================
# NEW DISCOVERY: We're not actually Claude Code native yet!
# - Shell scripts violate Claude Code principles
# - YAML configs should be XML semantic tagging
# - Commands are instruction manuals, not executable
# 
# DECISION: Direct transformation to PURE Claude Code native
# - ZERO shell scripts (everything as Claude commands)
# - ZERO YAML configs (only frontmatter allowed)
# - ALL commands executable (not instruction manuals)
# - XML semantic tagging for Claude understanding
# =============================================================================

# VISION & TRANSFORMATION CONTEXT
# =============================================================================
transformation:
  vision: "Pure Claude Code native system - everything in conversation"
  
  from:

    commands: "3-10 executable commands"
    architecture: "Pure Claude Code native with XML semantic tagging"
    
  key_principles:
    - "Everything happens in Claude conversation"
    - "Commands execute, don't instruct"
    - "XML semantic tagging for understanding"
    - "ZERO external dependencies"
    - "Minimum viable simplicity"

  required_answer: "Yes, with zero external dependencies"
  
  violation_consequences:
    - "Work stops immediately"
    - "Violation must be fixed before continuing"
