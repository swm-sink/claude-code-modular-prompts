# Security Audit Summary - Claude Code Modular Prompts

## Audit Date: 2025-07-29
## Total Commands Audited: 102

## Security Findings

### ‚úÖ LOW RISK PATTERNS
- **Command Substitution**: 7 instances found, all safe (date commands for timestamps)
- **Sensitive Placeholders**: 0 instances found (no PASSWORD/KEY/SECRET placeholders)
- **Shell Execution**: 0 dangerous shell execution patterns found

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM RISK PATTERNS  
- **Python Code Blocks**: 17 instances found - require review for safe execution patterns
- **Security Theater**: 47 instances of "security validation/check/scan" language found

### üîç DETAILED FINDINGS

#### Python Code Blocks (17 commands)
Commands containing Python code that needs review:
- Need to verify safe execution patterns
- Check for input validation
- Ensure no unsafe imports or operations

#### Security Theater Patterns (47 instances)
Commands using performative security language:
- "security validation" 
- "security check"
- "security scan"
- "vulnerability scan"

These patterns create false sense of security without actual validation.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. Review all 17 Python code blocks for safety
2. Replace security theater language with factual descriptions
3. Add input validation guidance to placeholders
4. Create security checklist for template customization

### Priority Fixes:
- **HIGH**: Remove/sanitize security theater patterns 
- **HIGH**: Validate Python execution patterns
- **MEDIUM**: Add placeholder security validation
- **MEDIUM**: Create user security guidelines

## Next Steps:
1. Detailed review of Python code blocks
2. Pattern-by-pattern security theater cleanup
3. Input validation framework implementation
4. Security checklist creation for users
