## 🧠 **Reasoning Commands**

### `/reason-react` - Dynamic Problem Solving

#### **Example 1: API Performance Investigation**
```bash
/reason-react "Our REST API response time increased from 200ms to 800ms over the past week. Investigate the cause and provide a solution."

# Expected Reasoning Trace:
# Thought: Need to systematically investigate API performance degradation
# Action: Analyze server metrics, database performance, and recent deployments
# Observation: Database query time increased 4x, new query pattern detected
# 
# Thought: New feature deployment may have introduced inefficient queries
# Action: Review recent code changes and identify problematic queries
# Observation: New user analytics feature performs N+1 queries
# 
# Thought: Need to optimize query patterns and add proper indexing
# Action: Design optimized query strategy and database indexes
# Solution: Specific SQL optimizations reducing response time to 180ms

# Performance: Problem solved in 3 reasoning cycles, 73% response time improvement
```

#### **Example 2: System Architecture Decision**
```bash
/reason-react "We're scaling from 10K to 1M users. Should we use microservices, maintain monolith, or hybrid approach?"

# Reasoning Process:
# Thought: Need to evaluate scalability options based on team size, complexity, and growth
# Action: Analyze current system bottlenecks and team capabilities
# Observation: Database is primary bottleneck, team experienced with monoliths
# 
# Thought: Microservices add complexity but enable independent scaling
# Action: Compare operational overhead vs scaling benefits
# Observation: Hybrid approach allows gradual migration with immediate benefits
# 
# Solution: Modular monolith with extracted high-load services
# - Extract user service and analytics service as microservices
# - Maintain core business logic in optimized monolith
# - Use event-driven communication for loose coupling

# Result: 67% faster deployment with reduced operational complexity
```

#### **Example 3: Security Incident Response**
```bash
/reason-react "We detected unusual API access patterns - 1000+ requests/minute from new IP ranges accessing user data endpoints. Investigate and respond appropriately."

# Security Response Reasoning:
# Thought: Potential security incident requiring immediate assessment and response
# Action: Analyze access patterns, IP geolocation, and requested endpoints
# Observation: Coordinated access from multiple IPs, pattern suggests data scraping
# 
# Thought: Need immediate protection while investigating scope of breach
# Action: Implement rate limiting and temporarily block suspicious IPs
# Observation: Attack stopped, no sensitive data appears compromised
# 
# Thought: Need comprehensive security audit and improved monitoring
# Action: Conduct full security review and implement enhanced monitoring
# Solution: 
# - Immediate: Rate limiting and IP blocking implemented
# - Short-term: Enhanced monitoring and alerting deployed
# - Long-term: API authentication improvements and abuse detection

# Outcome: Incident contained in 15 minutes, zero data breach confirmed
```
