# Claude Code Modular Prompts - Session Tracking

## Project Overview
**Goal:** Clean and organize Claude Code prompt repository with high-quality commands and context engineering

**Current State:** Complex project with scattered structure, 146+ commands across multiple directories, needs systematic cleanup and consolidation into proper Claude Code format.

## Session Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis âœ…
- [x] Explored project structure (tallinn/, .main/, root level)
- [x] Researched Claude Code best practices via official docs
- [x] Analyzed existing .claude configurations and command structures
- [x] Identified key issues: missing root CLAUDE.md, scattered configs, over-complex structure

### Phase 2: Planning & Design âœ…  
- [x] Synthesized findings into actionable cleanup areas
- [x] Created initial cleanup plan (too aggressive)
- [x] Critiqued and refined plan (non-destructive approach)
- [x] Finalized detailed implementation steps with TDD approach

### Phase 3: Implementation ðŸ”„
- [x] Created session tracking (this file)
- [ ] Create root .claude directory structure
- [ ] Create comprehensive CLAUDE.md at project root
- [ ] Set up proper .claude/settings.json
- [ ] Audit and prioritize existing commands (146 â†’ ~50-70)
- [ ] Migrate high-priority commands with TDD approach
- [ ] Implement security review for all commands
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Performance optimization and testing
- [ ] Final cleanup and archival

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Non-Destructive Approach:** Keep tallinn/ as reference during migration
2. **Quality Over Quantity:** Focus on 50-70 high-value commands vs all 146
3. **TDD Implementation:** Test first, then migrate each command
4. **Security First:** Every command gets security review
5. **Proper Claude Code Structure:** Root-level .claude/ with proper hierarchy

## Technical Notes

### Current Structure Issues:
- No root CLAUDE.md (required for Claude Code project memory)
- .claude folder at wrong location (should be project root)
- Multiple duplicate command sets (tallinn/.claude/, claude_prompt_factory/)
- 40+ scattered markdown documentation files
- Test coverage only 19%

### Target Structure:
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md                    # Project memory (required)
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/                     # Claude Code configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.json           # Permissions and tool config
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commands/               # Curated command set (~50-70)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/               # Essential commands
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ development/        # Dev workflow
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ security/           # Security tools
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ testing/            # Test automation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ docs/                   # Claude Code specific docs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                   # User-facing documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                      # Comprehensive test suite
â””â”€â”€ tallinn.archive/            # Archived original structure
```

## Context for Next Session

**Current Priority:** Begin Phase 3 implementation starting with root structure creation.

**Key Files to Remember:**
- `/Users/smenssink/conductor/repo/claude-code-modular-prompts/tallinn/.claude/commands/` - Source of 146 commands to audit
- `/Users/smenssink/conductor/repo/claude-code-modular-prompts/tallinn/CLAUDE.md` - Existing project context
- `/Users/smenssink/conductor/repo/claude-code-modular-prompts/.claude/settings.local.json` - Current minimal settings

**Quality Gates:**
- All migrated commands must have tests
- Security review required for each command
- Performance baseline must be established
- Documentation must be comprehensive and clear

**Success Criteria:**
- Clean, compliant Claude Code project structure
- 50-70 high-quality, tested commands
- 80%+ test coverage
- Complete documentation
- Fast command loading (<100ms per command)
- Zero security vulnerabilities
