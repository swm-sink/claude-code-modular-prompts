# Adapt Framework to Your Project - Manual Guide

## üéØ What This Command Actually Does

**I'm a guide, not an automation engine.** I'll help you manually customize this Claude Code framework by:
- üìã Providing step-by-step checklists
- üìù Generating copy-paste ready configurations
- üîç Listing all files that need manual updates
- ‚úÖ Creating validation checklists to verify your work

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What I Cannot Do
- ‚ùå Automatically detect your tech stack (you'll tell me)
- ‚ùå Replace placeholders in files (I'll show you what to replace)
- ‚ùå Create configuration files (I'll give you the content to paste)
- ‚ùå Calculate scores programmatically (I'll provide a checklist)

## Choose Your Adaptation Mode

### Express Mode (15-20 minutes of manual work)
I'll guide you through 50 quick questions, then provide:
- Complete list of all replacements needed
- Copy-paste ready configurations
- File-by-file update instructions

### Guided Mode (30-45 minutes of manual work)
We'll go through each customization step with:
- Detailed explanations for each choice
- Examples of common patterns
- Best practices for your domain

Which mode would you prefer?
1. Express checklist mode
2. Detailed guided mode
3. Just show me what needs changing

## What I'll Customize

**Project Information**:
- [INSERT_PROJECT_NAME] ‚Üí Your actual project name
- [INSERT_DOMAIN] ‚Üí Your domain (web-dev, data-science, devops, etc.)
- [INSERT_TECH_STACK] ‚Üí Your technology stack

**Team & Workflow**:
- [INSERT_TEAM_SIZE] ‚Üí Your team size
- [INSERT_WORKFLOW_TYPE] ‚Üí Your development workflow
- [INSERT_COMPANY_NAME] ‚Üí Your organization

**Technical Choices**:
- [INSERT_PRIMARY_LANGUAGE] ‚Üí Your main programming language
- [INSERT_TESTING_FRAMEWORK] ‚Üí Your testing tools
- [INSERT_CI_CD_PLATFORM] ‚Üí Your deployment pipeline

## Manual Tech Stack Identification

Since I cannot automatically scan your files, please tell me about your project:

**Common tech stacks I can help you adapt for:**
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Look for package.json
- **Python**: Look for requirements.txt, Pipfile, or setup.py
- **Go**: Look for go.mod
- **Rust**: Look for Cargo.toml
- **Java**: Look for pom.xml or build.gradle
- **PHP**: Look for composer.json
- **Ruby**: Look for Gemfile

**Quick check**: What files do you see in your project root? I'll help you identify the right adaptations based on what you tell me.
