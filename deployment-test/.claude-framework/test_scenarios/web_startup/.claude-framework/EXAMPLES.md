## üéØ Tips for Manual Customization

### 1. Use Your Editor's Find & Replace
Most editors support project-wide Find & Replace:
- **VS Code**: Ctrl+Shift+H (Cmd+Shift+H on Mac)
- **IntelliJ**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- **Sublime**: Ctrl+Shift+F (Cmd+Shift+F on Mac)

### 2. Order of Replacement Matters
Replace in this order to avoid partial replacements:
1. Longer, more specific placeholders first
2. Shorter, general placeholders last

### 3. Validate After Replacement
Use the validation command to check:
```bash
/validate-adaptation
```

### 4. Keep Reference Copy
The `.claude-framework/` directory maintains clean templates for reference.

### 5. Document Your Choices
Create a `ADAPTATION-NOTES.md` file documenting:
- Which placeholders you replaced
- What values you used
- Any commands you removed or modified
- Custom configurations you added

## üìö Advanced Customization Patterns

### Pattern 1: Domain-Specific Language
For specialized domains, you might need additional replacements:
```
[INSERT_DOMAIN_ENTITY] ‚Üí "Order" (for e-commerce)
[INSERT_DOMAIN_ACTION] ‚Üí "Process Payment" (for fintech)
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Environment Setup
For projects with multiple environments:
```
[INSERT_DEV_ENVIRONMENT] ‚Üí "development.myapp.local"
[INSERT_STAGING_ENVIRONMENT] ‚Üí "staging.myapp.com"
[INSERT_PROD_ENVIRONMENT] ‚Üí "api.myapp.com"
```

### Pattern 3: Team-Specific Workflows
For specific team processes:
```
[INSERT_CODE_REVIEW_TOOL] ‚Üí "GitHub PRs"
[INSERT_COMMUNICATION_PLATFORM] ‚Üí "Slack"
[INSERT_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_TOOL] ‚Üí "Jira"
```

## üîÑ Keeping Templates Updated

When new versions of the template library are released:

1. **Check for Updates**:
   ```bash
   cd .claude-framework
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Review Changes**:
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD~1
   ```

3. **Manually Apply Updates**:
   - Compare your customized files with new templates
   - Manually merge beneficial changes
   - Re-apply your placeholder replacements

4. **Use Sync Guide**:
   ```bash
   /sync-from-reference
   ```
