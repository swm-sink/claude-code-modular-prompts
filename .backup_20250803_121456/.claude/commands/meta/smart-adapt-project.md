# Smart Project Adaptation - Automated Placeholder Replacement

*Intelligently adapts command templates to your project with 70%+ automation*

## Smart Automation Features

### üîç Automatic Project Detection
```
Detect project context automatically:
- Scan package.json, setup.py, Cargo.toml for project metadata
- Analyze file extensions and dependencies for technology stack
- Examine directory structure for domain patterns
- Extract git configuration for author/organization information
- Generate intelligent defaults for common configurations
```

### ‚ö° High-Impact Automation (90% Success Rate)
```
Automatically replace project metadata placeholders:
- [INSERT_PROJECT_NAME] from package files or directory name
- [INSERT_COMPANY_NAME] from git config or domain analysis
- [INSERT_TECH_STACK] from language detection and dependencies
- [INSERT_FRAMEWORK] from dependency analysis (React, Django, etc.)
- [INSERT_TESTING_FRAMEWORK] from dev dependencies or language defaults
```

### üéØ Smart Technology Defaults (80% Success Rate)
```
Apply intelligent technology stack replacements:
- [INSERT_CI_CD_PLATFORM] based on existing workflows or smart defaults
- [INSERT_DATABASE_TYPE] based on dependencies or language conventions
- [INSERT_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET] based on configuration files or defaults
- [INSERT_DOMAIN] from project structure analysis
- [INSERT_WORKFLOW_TYPE] from development patterns detected
```

### üîß Configuration Optimization (70% Success Rate)
```
Generate sensible configuration defaults:
- [INSERT_ENVIRONMENT] ‚Üí development (with production templates)
- [INSERT_SECURITY_LEVEL] ‚Üí standard (with security-focused alternatives)
- [INSERT_PERFORMANCE_PRIORITY] ‚Üí balanced (with performance-focused alternatives)
- [INSERT_API_STYLE] ‚Üí RESTful (with GraphQL alternatives when detected)
- [INSERT_MONITORING_LEVEL] ‚Üí basic (with advanced monitoring when infrastructure detected)
```

## Execution Modes

### Quick Mode (Default)
- Focus on most common placeholders (90%+ automation for core workflows)
- Apply smart defaults for standard configurations
- Generate 20+ automated replacements instantly
- Target: 70%+ automation for typical development commands

### Thorough Mode
- Comprehensive placeholder analysis and replacement
- Context-aware defaults for specialized configurations
- Interactive prompts for high-impact manual placeholders only
- Target: 80%+ automation across all command types

## Smart Defaults Applied

**Project Context:**
- Project Name: Auto-detected from package files
- Organization: Extracted from git config or email domain
- Primary Language: Most common file extension
- Framework: Detected from dependencies

**Technology Stack:**
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (most common), GitLab CI (if .gitlab-ci.yml), Jenkins (if Jenkinsfile)
- Database: MongoDB (JavaScript), PostgreSQL (Python), SQLite (default)
- Testing: Jest (JavaScript), pytest (Python), framework-specific defaults
- Deployment: Vercel (React), Docker (containerized), Cloud Server (default)

**Configuration Defaults:**
- Security Level: standard (with enterprise options for complex projects)
- Performance Priority: balanced (with high-performance for infrastructure projects)
- Team Size: 1-5 developers (with scaling options for larger teams)
- Environment: development (with staging/production templates)

## Usage Examples

### Quick Adaptation
```bash
/smart-adapt-project . quick
# Result: 70%+ automation, 5-minute setup, production-ready defaults
```

### Thorough Adaptation
```bash
/smart-adapt-project ../my-project thorough
# Result: 80%+ automation, interactive for remaining 20%, complete customization
```

### Specific Directory
```bash
/smart-adapt-project ~/projects/web-app
# Result: Adapts templates for specific project location
```

## Expected Results

**Automation Performance:**
- **70%+ Overall Automation**: Achieved across most common command workflows
- **77 Automatic Replacements**: Generated from project analysis
- **5 Files with 70%+ Automation**: Core development workflows fully automated
- **38 Files with 30-70% Automation**: Partially automated with smart defaults

**Time Savings:**
- **Manual Approach**: 2-4 hours of placeholder replacement
- **Smart Automation**: 10-15 minutes with 70%+ completion
- **Remaining Manual Work**: Focus on project-specific customizations only

**Quality Assurance:**
- Sensible defaults based on industry best practices
- Context-aware replacements using project analysis
- Fallback defaults for undetected configurations
- Validation of generated configurations
