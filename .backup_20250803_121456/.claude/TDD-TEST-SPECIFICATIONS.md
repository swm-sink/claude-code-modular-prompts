*Generated: 2025-07-30*
*Methodology: Test-Driven Development for Prompt Engineering*
*Coverage: 25 atomic components (10 existing + 15 planned)*

## ðŸ§ª TDD METHODOLOGY FOR PROMPT COMPONENTS

### Test-Driven Development Approach
1. **Red**: Write failing test that defines expected component behavior
2. **Green**: Implement minimal component code to pass the test
3. **Refactor**: Improve component while maintaining test success
4. **Validate**: Verify component works in real Claude Code scenarios

### Test Categories for Prompt Components
```yaml
Unit_Tests:
  - Input validation and parsing
  - Output format and structure
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Component isolation

Integration_Tests:
  - Component combinations
  - Data flow between components
  - Compatibility validation
  - Performance impact

End_to_End_Tests:
  - Full command assembly
  - Real-world usage scenarios
  - User experience validation
  - Claude Code integration
```
