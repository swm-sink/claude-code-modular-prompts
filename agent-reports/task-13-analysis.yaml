  notes: |
    - Only 2 occurrences found, both in descriptive text
    - Line 142 is describing what we're moving FROM (might want to keep for contrast)
    - Line 881 should definitely be updated to reflect new architecture
    
  recommendations:
    - Update line 881 to "Deep discovery engine architecture and standards"
    - Consider if line 142 should stay as-is since it's describing the OLD approach we're moving FROM
