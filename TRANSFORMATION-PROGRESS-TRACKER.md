## Execution Guidelines

### Daily Process
1. **Morning**: Review this tracker and select next task
2. **Execution**: Follow 14-step methodology precisely
3. **Evening**: Update tracker with actual times and notes
4. **Commit**: Update progress in git

### Status Definitions
- **Not Started**: Task not begun
- **In Progress**: Currently executing 14-step process
- **Blocked**: Waiting on dependency or issue
- **Completed**: All 14 steps done and committed
- **Validated**: Passed final review

### Time Tracking
- **Estimated**: Initial estimate from decomposition
- **Actual**: Real time taken (including 14 steps)
- **Variance**: Difference to improve estimates

### Quality Metrics
- **First Time Success**: Task completed without Step 11 corrections
- **Research Quality**: Number of authoritative sources found
- **Plan Accuracy**: How closely implementation matched plan

## Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|--------|
| Scope creep in atomic tasks | Medium | High | Strict boundary enforcement | Active |
| 14-step overhead too high | Low | Medium | Track and optimize process | Monitor |
| Dependencies not identified | Low | High | Careful planning review | Active |
| Agent complexity | Medium | Medium | Start simple, iterate | Active |

## Lessons Learned Log

| Date | Task | Learning | Action |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| 2025-08-03 | Task 1.1 | Test limitations exist for mode detection in transformation projects | Document known limitations, not bugs |
| 2025-08-03 | Task 1.2 | Agent orchestration requires comprehensive context infrastructure | Create full context framework before agent creation |
| 2025-08-03 | Task 1.3 | Context engineering benefits from research-driven CWA framework | Implement 11-layer Context Window Architecture for optimal navigation |
| 2025-08-03 | Task 1.4 | Command scaffolding requires comprehensive template and validation framework | Implement modular template system with VERIFY protocol and evidence-based patterns |

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-08-03 | Keep dual detection methods (active + MODE files) | Provides robustness and fallback | More reliable mode detection |
