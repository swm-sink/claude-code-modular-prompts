# Phase 2 Orchestration Plan - Contamination Cleanup

## Mission Overview

**Objective:** Complete TOP 10 priority file cleanup and expand to high-visibility command files
**Target:** 48 contaminations in TOP 10 + ~50 in command files = ~100 total
**Agent Deployment:** 5-7 specialized agents

## Agent Assignments

### Agent 5: Issue Template Specialist
**Target:** ISSUE-TEMPLATES-GENERATOR.md
**Contaminations:** 11 (8 "Template Library", 3 "Progressive Disclosure")
**Mission:** Transform all 72 task templates to use "Claude Context Architect" terminology

### Agent 6: Production Validator
**Target:** reports/deployment/PRODUCTION-VALIDATION-COMPLETION-REPORT.md
**Contaminations:** 7 "Template Library" references
**Mission:** Update deployment validation report with correct project terminology

### Agent 7: Documentation Accuracy Specialist
**Target:** reports/analysis/STEP-88-DOCUMENTATION-ACCURACY-RESULTS.md
**Contaminations:** 8 (8 "Template Library", 2 "Claude Code Modular Prompts")
**Mission:** Clean documentation accuracy analysis to reflect context engineering focus

### Agent 8: XML Schema Specialist
**Target:** docs/xml-schema/xml-tagging-specification.md
**Contaminations:** 7 (5 "Progressive Disclosure", 2 "Template Library")
**Mission:** Update XML schema documentation for context engineering system

### Agent 9: Release Package Specialist
**Target:** releases/v1.0/PACKAGING-COMPLETION-REPORT.md
**Contaminations:** 6 (5 "Template Library", 1 "Component Library")
**Mission:** Clean release packaging to properly describe context engineering deliverables

### Agent 10: Command File Specialist (Batch)
**Targets:** 
- .claude/project/commands/core/quick-help.md (18 contaminations)
- .claude/project/commands/meta/welcome.md (16 contaminations)
- .claude/project/commands/meta/adapt-to-project.md (10 contaminations)
**Total Contaminations:** 44 across 3 critical user-facing commands
**Mission:** Update high-visibility commands that users interact with first

### Agent 11: Quality Report Specialist
**Target:** reports/analysis/PHASE4-QUALITY-ASSURANCE-COMPLETE.md
**Contaminations:** 9 (5 "Progressive Disclosure", 3 "Template Library")
**Mission:** Final TOP 10 cleanup to complete priority list

## Execution Timeline

### Wave 1 (Agents 5-9): TOP 10 Completion
- Deploy simultaneously
- Expected duration: 1-2 hours
- Total contaminations: 39

### Wave 2 (Agents 10-11): Command Files + Final TOP 10
- Deploy after Wave 1 validation
- Expected duration: 1-2 hours  
- Total contaminations: 53

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative:
- TOP 10 files: 100% clean (0 contaminations)
- Critical command files: 3 highest-visibility commands cleaned
- Total reduction: ~100 contaminations removed
- New contamination baseline: ~830 (from 933)

### Qualitative:
- User-facing commands properly describe context engineering
- Deployment documentation reflects actual project purpose
- XML schema aligned with context engineering architecture

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Cross-file References:** Some files may reference others already cleaned
   - Mitigation: Agents verify terminology consistency

2. **Complex Nested References:** JSON files with deep contamination
   - Mitigation: Careful search/replace with context awareness

3. **User Visibility:** Command files are actively used
   - Mitigation: Extra validation on user-facing content

## Phase 3 Preview

After Phase 2 completion, Phase 3 will target:
- Remaining command files (~20 files)
- Core documentation files
- High-traffic user guides
- Estimated 150-200 contaminations

## Validation Checkpoint

After Phase 2:
1. Run comprehensive contamination recount
2. Verify TOP 10 = 0 contaminations
3. Test key user workflows with cleaned commands
4. Update CLAUDE.md if contamination <50%
5. Generate Phase 3 detailed plan
