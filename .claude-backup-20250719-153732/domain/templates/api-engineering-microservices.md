## Domain Overview

API Engineering & Microservices R&D domain template provides specialized framework configuration for building scalable APIs, microservices architectures, and distributed systems. This template optimizes the Claude Code Framework for API design, service architecture, and distributed system patterns.

    <service_autonomy>Independent service development and deployment</service_autonomy>
  </rd_characteristics>
</api_engineering_microservices_domain>
```

## Quality Gates

```xml
<quality_gates>
