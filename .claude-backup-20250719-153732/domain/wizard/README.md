## 🎯 What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this getting-started process, you'll have:

- **Domain-Optimized Framework**: A customized version of Claude Code tailored to your specific field
- **Project-Specific Commands**: Custom commands that understand your codebase and workflows
- **Intelligent Routing**: AI that knows how to handle your domain-specific challenges
- **Quality Gates**: Validation systems that ensure your standards are met
- **Iterative Improvement**: A system that gets better as you use it

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Claude Code Access**: Active Claude Code subscription with access to Claude 4
- [ ] **Project Repository**: The target project where you want to integrate this framework
- [ ] **Domain Knowledge**: Understanding of your specific domain requirements
- [ ] **30-60 Minutes**: Time to complete the initial setup and customization

## 🗺️ Adaptation Journey

### Phase 1: Safe Integration (5-10 minutes)
1. **Repository Analysis**: Understand your project structure
2. **Conflict Detection**: Identify any potential integration issues
3. **Backup Strategy**: Create safety nets for rollback if needed
4. **Incremental Setup**: Step-by-step integration process

### Phase 2: Domain Discovery (15-25 minutes)
1. **Domain Classification**: Identify your primary domain and subdomain
2. **Workflow Analysis**: Understand your development patterns
3. **Tool Integration**: Map your existing tools and processes
4. **Quality Standards**: Define your quality gates and success metrics

### Phase 3: Framework Customization (20-30 minutes)
1. **Command Adaptation**: Customize commands for your domain
2. **Module Selection**: Choose and configure relevant modules
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Optimize prompts for your specific use cases
4. **Integration Testing**: Validate the adapted framework

### Phase 4: Validation & Iteration (Ongoing)
1. **Performance Testing**: Ensure the framework meets your needs
2. **Team Integration**: Onboard your team to the new workflow
