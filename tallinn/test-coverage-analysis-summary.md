## Testing Infrastructure Assessment

### Current State
- **Test Framework**: pytest with asyncio, coverage, mock, xdist
- **Test Structure**: Unit, integration, E2E directories exist
- **Test Utilities**: Partial `test_utils.py` and `conftest.py`
- **CI/CD**: Parallel testing attempted but misconfigured

### Critical Infrastructure Issues
1. **Missing Fixtures**: Core fixtures not implemented
2. **Async Testing**: Improper configuration causing failures
3. **Mock Strategy**: Inconsistent mocking approach
4. **Test Data**: Insufficient test data generation
5. **Import Paths**: Broken relative imports in test modules

### Infrastructure Repair Plan
```python
# Required fixtures for conftest.py
@pytest.fixture
def temp_config_dir():
    # Temporary configuration directory

@pytest.fixture  
def mock_mcp_server():
    # MCP server mock with proper async handling

@pytest.fixture
def temp_project_dir():
    # Temporary project structure
```

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK (Immediate Action)
