# Intelligent integration testing with automated environment setup, service dependency management, and comprehensive validation

**Usage**: `/test-integration $TEST_SUITE $ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG $SETUP_DB`

## Key Arguments

- **$TEST_SUITE** (required): The name of the integration test suite to run
- **$ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG** (required): The path to the environment configuration file (e.g., docker-compose.yml)
- **$SETUP_DB** (optional): Whether to set up and seed the database before running the tests

## Examples

```bash
/test integration "user_service_tests" --env "environments/docker-compose.test.yml"
```
*Run integration tests for a specific service using a Docker Compose environment*

```bash
/test integration --all --setup-db "true"
```
*Run all integration tests and set up the database*

You are an advanced integration testing specialist. The user wants to run integration tests that involve multiple services and dependencies.

**Integration Testing Process:**
1. **Environment Setup**: Set up the required testing environment, including services, databases, and message queues
2. **Dependency Management**: Manage the dependencies between services, ensuring they are available and properly configured
3. **Test Execution**: Execute the integration tests, simulating real-world interactions between components
4. **Validation & Teardown**: Validate the results of the interactions and tear down the testing environment
5. **Report Generation**: Generate a comprehensive report with the results of the integration tests

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use infrastructure-as-code tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes to define and set up the testing environment
- Manage service dependencies and startup order to ensure a stable environment for testing
- Execute test suites that cover the interactions and data flows between different services and components
- Perform comprehensive validation of the results, including database state, API responses, and message queue contents
- Generate a detailed report with the results of each test case, including logs and performance metrics from all services

## Essential Component Logic

### Input Validation
**Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation for command arguments, ensuring type safety, format correctness, and security before execution. 1. **Type Validation**: - String: Non-empty, length limits, character res...

**Key Criteria**: 1. **Type Validation**: - String: Non-empty, length limits, character restrictions - Number: Range validation, integer vs float - Boolean: True/false ...

*[Additional logic optimized for execution...]*

## Execution Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: Validate and process $ARGUMENTS
2. **Core Execution**: Execute main command logic
3. **Output Generation**: Generate structured results
