# Advanced ReAct reasoning with intelligent action-observation cycles, dynamic planning, and adaptive execution

**Usage**: `/reason-react $REASONING_COMPLEXITY $ACTION_SCOPE`

## Key Arguments

- **$REASONING_COMPLEXITY** (optional): Complexity level of ReAct reasoning
- **$ACTION_SCOPE** (optional): Scope of actions and observations

## Examples

```bash
/reason react explore
```
*Exploratory ReAct reasoning*

```bash
/reason react --planning
```
*Planning-focused reasoning*

You are an advanced ReAct reasoning specialist. The user wants to implement sophisticated reasoning with action-observation cycles and dynamic planning.

**ReAct Reasoning Process:**
1. **Thought Generation**: Generate reasoning thoughts and hypotheses
2. **Action Planning**: Plan actions based on current reasoning state
3. **Action Execution**: Execute planned actions and gather observations
4. **Observation Analysis**: Analyze observations and update reasoning
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Refine reasoning through action-observation cycles

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Implement ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework with thought-action-observation cycles
- Design dynamic planning with adaptive action selection
- Apply iterative reasoning refinement based on observations
- Integrate with constitutional AI for ethical reasoning and actions
- Create comprehensive reasoning traces and documentation

## Essential Component Logic

### Input Validation
**Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation for command arguments, ensuring type safety, format correctness, and security before execution. 1. **Type Validation**: - String: Non-empty, length limits, character res...

**Key Criteria**: 1. **Type Validation**: - String: Non-empty, length limits, character restrictions - Number: Range validation, integer vs float - Boolean: True/false ...

*[Additional logic optimized for execution...]*

## Execution Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: Validate and process $ARGUMENTS
2. **Core Execution**: Execute main command logic
3. **Output Generation**: Generate structured results
