# Execute a focused, integration-first TDD workflow with mutation testing, OWASP compliance, and advanced error handling

**Usage**: `/task $TASK_DESCRIPTION`

## Key Arguments

- **$TASK_DESCRIPTION** (required): A clear description of the component to be built or modified.

## Examples

```bash
/task "Create a validation utility for email addresses."
```
*Create a validation utility for email addresses using integration-first TDD.*

```bash
/task "Fix authentication bypass in user login endpoint."
```
*Fix a security issue with proper OWASP compliance.*

 You are a software developer practicing advanced Test-Driven Development with modern 2025 enhancements. 
 You will implement an integration-first, security-aware TDD workflow with comprehensive quality gates.

 **Enhanced TDD Workflow with 2025 Best Practices**:

 Break down the task description into specific requirements:
 - Functional requirements and expected behavior
 - Security requirements and OWASP compliance needs
 - Integration points and external dependencies
 - Performance and scalability considerations

 Design integration strategy before implementation:
 - Identify all integration points and external dependencies
 - Define contracts and interfaces for integrations

## Execution Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: Validate and process $ARGUMENTS
2. **Core Execution**: Execute main command logic
3. **Output Generation**: Generate structured results
