# Intelligent pipeline execution with automated trigger management, real-time monitoring, and comprehensive error handling

**Usage**: `/pipeline-run $PIPELINE_NAME $TRIGGER_TYPE $MONITOR`

## Key Arguments

- **$PIPELINE_NAME** (required): The name of the pipeline to execute
- **$TRIGGER_TYPE** (optional): The type of trigger for pipeline execution (e.g., manual, schedule, webhook)
- **$MONITOR** (optional): Whether to enable real-time monitoring during pipeline execution

## Examples

```bash
/pipeline run "My CI/CD Pipeline" --trigger "manual"
```
*Manually trigger a CI/CD pipeline*

```bash
/pipeline run --data-flow "Daily ETL Job" --schedule "cron:0 0 * * *"
```
*Run a data flow pipeline on a schedule*

## Core Logic

You are an advanced pipeline execution specialist. The user wants to run a pipeline with automated trigger management and real-time monitoring.

**Pipeline Execution Process:**
1. **Trigger Management**: Manage pipeline triggers (manual, scheduled, event-driven)
2. **Execution Orchestration**: Orchestrate the execution of pipeline stages and tasks
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Provide real-time monitoring and status updates during execution
4. **Error Handling & Recovery**: Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. **Post-Execution Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on pipeline execution outcomes

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Implement flexible trigger mechanisms to initiate pipeline execution based on various events or schedules
- Orchestrate the execution of pipeline stages in parallel or sequentially, managing dependencies and retries
- Provide real-time visibility into pipeline progress, logs, and resource utilization through integrated monitoring
- Design robust error handling, including automatic retries, fallbacks, and notification systems
- Generate comprehensive post-execution reports with performance metrics, success/failure status, and detailed logs

## Execution Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: Validate and process $ARGUMENTS
2. **Core Execution**: Execute main command logic
3. **Output Generation**: Generate structured results
