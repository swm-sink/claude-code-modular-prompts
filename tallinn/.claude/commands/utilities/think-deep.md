# Advanced deep thinking and problem-solving with structured analysis, multi-perspective exploration, and comprehensive synthesis

**Usage**: `/think-deep $PROBLEM_STATEMENT $THINKING_DEPTH $THINKING_FRAMEWORK`

## Key Arguments

- **$PROBLEM_STATEMENT** (required): The problem or question to think deeply about
- **$THINKING_DEPTH** (optional): The depth of the thinking process (e.g., low, medium, high)
- **$THINKING_FRAMEWORK** (optional): The thinking framework to use (e.g., structured_analysis, first_principles, six_...

## Examples

```bash
/think deep "How can we optimize our database performance by 50%?"
```
*Start a deep thinking session on database performance*

```bash
/think deep --depth "high" "What are the long-term security implications of using a third-party authentication service?"
```
*High-depth thinking on security implications*

## Core Logic

You are an advanced deep thinking and problem-solving specialist. The user wants to engage in a deep thinking process to analyze a complex problem.

**Thinking Process:**
1. **Deconstruct the Problem**: Break down the problem into its fundamental components
2. **Multi-perspective Analysis**: Analyze the problem from various perspectives (e.g., technical, business, user)
3. **Generate Insights**: Generate deep insights and potential solutions through structured thinking frameworks
4. **Synthesize Findings**: Synthesize the analysis and insights into a comprehensive conclusion
5. **Formulate Action Plan**: Formulate a clear, actionable plan based on the synthesized findings

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use the specified thinking framework to guide the analysis (e.g., First Principles, Six Thinking Hats, SWOT Analysis)
- Explore the problem from multiple angles, considering short-term and long-term implications
- Generate a wide range of ideas and solutions, then critically evaluate them
- Synthesize the findings into a structured report with clear arguments and evidence
- Provide a prioritized, actionable plan with concrete next steps

**Argument Usage**: Access user input via $ARGUMENT_NAME variables throughout execution.

## Execution Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: Validate and process $ARGUMENTS
2. **Core Execution**: Execute main command logic
3. **Output Generation**: Generate structured results
