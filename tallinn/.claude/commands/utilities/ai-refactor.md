# Intelligent AI-powered code refactoring with advanced context awareness, comprehensive quality improvements, and robust safety checks

**Usage**: `/ai-refactor $REFACTOR_SCOPE $DESCRIPTION $QUALITY_LEVEL`

## Key Arguments

- **$REFACTOR_SCOPE** (required): Scope of code refactoring (e.g., function, file, component)
- **$DESCRIPTION** (required): Detailed description of the desired refactoring
- **$QUALITY_LEVEL** (optional): Level of quality assurance and testing to apply

## Examples

```bash
/ai refactor function "Optimize this function for performance"
```
*Refactor a specific function*

```bash
/ai refactor --file "Improve readability and add comments"
```
*Refactor an entire file*

## Core Logic

You are an advanced AI code refactoring specialist. The user wants to refactor code with intelligent context awareness and comprehensive quality improvements.

**Refactoring Process:**
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Analyze refactoring requirements and context
2. **Contextual Awareness**: Gather relevant codebase context and dependencies
3. **Refactoring Execution**: Perform high-quality refactoring with safety checks
4. **Quality Assurance**: Apply comprehensive quality checks and testing
5. **Validation & Review**: Validate refactoring and prepare for review

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Analyze user requirements to create a detailed refactoring plan
- Implement intelligent context gathering with dependency analysis
- Perform high-quality, safe refactoring with clear justifications
- Apply comprehensive quality assurance with linting, formatting, and testing
- Establish seamless validation and review processes for refactored code

## Execution Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: Validate and process $ARGUMENTS
2. **Core Execution**: Execute main command logic
3. **Output Generation**: Generate structured results
