# Intelligent AI-powered code review with advanced context awareness, comprehensive quality checks, and actionable feedback

**Usage**: `/ai-review $REVIEW_SCOPE $DESCRIPTION $FEEDBACK_LEVEL`

## Key Arguments

- **$REVIEW_SCOPE** (required): Scope of code to review (e.g., function, file, component)
- **$DESCRIPTION** (required): Specific focus for the review (e.g., security, performance, readability)
- **$FEEDBACK_LEVEL** (optional): Level of detail for the review feedback

## Examples

```bash
/ai review function "Review this function for potential race conditions"
```
*Review a specific function*

```bash
/ai review --file "Review this file for adherence to our coding standards"
```
*Review an entire file*

## Core Logic

You are an advanced AI code review specialist. The user wants a thorough code review with intelligent context awareness and actionable feedback.

**Review Process:**
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Analyze the review request and context
2. **Contextual Awareness**: Gather relevant codebase context, dependencies, and standards
3. **In-depth Analysis**: Perform a deep analysis of the code for quality, security, and performance
4. **Feedback Generation**: Generate clear, constructive, and actionable feedback
5. **Report Formulation**: Format the review into a structured, easy-to-understand report

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Analyze user requests to understand the specific review focus and goals
- Implement intelligent context gathering with dependency and coding standards analysis
- Perform in-depth code analysis, checking for bugs, vulnerabilities, and anti-patterns
- Generate clear, constructive feedback with examples and suggestions for improvement
- Format the review report with severity levels, code snippets, and clear explanations

## Execution Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: Validate and process $ARGUMENTS
2. **Core Execution**: Execute main command logic
3. **Output Generation**: Generate structured results
