# Advanced enterprise examples with industry best practices, scalable architectures, and comprehensive implementation patterns

**Usage**: `/enterprise-examples $USE_CASE $INDUSTRY $COMPLEXITY`

## Key Arguments

- **$USE_CASE** (required): Target use case or scenario (e.g., "onboarding", "compliance-audit", "global-dep...
- **$INDUSTRY** (optional): Industry context: healthcare, finance, manufacturing, government, tech, retail, ...
- **$COMPLEXITY** (optional): Complexity level: basic (simple examples), advanced (comprehensive), enterprise ...

## Examples

```bash
/enterprise-examples "compliance-audit" --industry=healthcare --complexity=enterprise
```
*Generate healthcare compliance examples*

```bash
/enterprise-examples "team-onboarding" --industry=finance --complexity=advanced
```
*Create financial services onboarding templates*
