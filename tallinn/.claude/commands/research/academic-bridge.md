# Advanced academic bridge with research integration, peer review systems, and scholarly collaboration frameworks

**Usage**: `/academic-bridge $RESEARCH_AREA $COLLABORATION $RIGOR`

## Key Arguments

- **$RESEARCH_AREA** (required): Research domain or academic area of focus (e.g., "machine-learning", "distribute...
- **$COLLABORATION** (optional): Collaboration type: research (exploration), publication (academic output), imple...
- **$RIGOR** (optional): Academic rigor level: exploratory (initial research), peer-review (standard), pu...

## Examples

```bash
/academic-bridge "machine-learning" --collaboration=publication --rigor=publication-ready
```
*Generate publication-ready machine learning research implementation*

```bash
/academic-bridge "distributed-systems" --collaboration=research --rigor=peer-review
```
*Explore distributed systems research with academic rigor*
