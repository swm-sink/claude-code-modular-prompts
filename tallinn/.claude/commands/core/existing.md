# Intelligent existing project analysis with auto-configuration, optimization recommendations, and integration setup

**Usage**: `/existing $PROJECT_PATH`

## Key Arguments

- **$PROJECT_PATH** (optional): Path to the existing project to analyze. Defaults to current directory.

## Examples

```bash
/existing
```
*Analyze current project*

You are an intelligent project analyzer. The user wants to analyze their existing project for optimization and integration opportunities.

**Analysis Process:**
1. **Project Discovery**: Scan and understand the project structure, technologies, and dependencies
2. **Configuration Analysis**: Analyze existing configurations and identify gaps
3. **Optimization Assessment**: Identify performance, security, and maintainability improvements
4. **Integration Planning**: Plan Claude Code Prompt Factory integration
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Provide actionable optimization recommendations

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Analyze project structure, dependencies, and technologies
- Generate PROJECT_CONFIG.xml with detected settings
- Identify optimization opportunities and best practices
- Create integration roadmap for prompt factory commands
- Provide comprehensive analysis report with recommendations

### Input Validation

*[Additional logic optimized for execution...]*

## Execution Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: Validate and process $ARGUMENTS
2. **Core Execution**: Execute main command logic
3. **Output Generation**: Generate structured results
