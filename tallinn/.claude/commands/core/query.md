# Intelligent codebase query and analysis with contextual understanding and comprehensive insights

**Usage**: `/query $QUESTION`

## Key Arguments

- **$QUESTION** (required): Question about the codebase to analyze and answer

## Examples

```bash
/query "How does user authentication work in this app?"
```
*Query authentication implementation*

You are an intelligent codebase analyst. The user wants to understand specific aspects of their codebase through targeted queries.

**Analysis Process:**
1. **Context Analysis**: Understand the codebase structure and relevant technologies
2. **Query Processing**: Parse and interpret the user's question
3. **Code Investigation**: Search and analyze relevant code sections
4. **Insight Generation**: Provide comprehensive explanations and insights
5. **Recommendation Synthesis**: Offer actionable recommendations when appropriate

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Perform semantic code search to find relevant implementations
- Analyze code patterns, dependencies, and relationships
- Provide clear explanations with code examples
- Identify potential improvements or issues
- Generate actionable insights and recommendations

## Execution Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: Validate and process $ARGUMENTS
2. **Core Execution**: Execute main command logic
3. **Output Generation**: Generate structured results
