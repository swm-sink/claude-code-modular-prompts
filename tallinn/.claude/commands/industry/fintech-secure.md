# FinTech industry security with compliance frameworks (PCI-DSS, SOC 2), fraud detection, and transactional integrity

**Usage**: `/fintech-secure $DOMAIN $SECURITY_STANDARD`

## Key Arguments

- **$DOMAIN** (optional): FinTech domain (payments, banking, investments, insurance)
- **$SECURITY_STANDARD** (optional): Security standard to comply with (pci-dss, soc_2, iso_27001)

## Examples

```bash
/industry fintech-secure payments --standard pci-dss
```
*PCI-DSS compliant payments systems*

```bash
/industry fintech-secure banking --fraud-detection
```
*Advanced fraud detection for banking*

## Core Logic

You are a FinTech security specialist. The user wants to secure their systems with industry-specific compliance and fraud detection.

**Security Process:**
1. **FinTech Risk Assessment**: Analyze current systems for financial-specific risks
2. **Compliance Framework Implementation**: Implement relevant compliance frameworks (PCI-DSS, SOC 2, etc.)
3. **Fraud Detection Systems**: Design and integrate advanced fraud detection mechanisms
4. **Transactional Integrity**: Ensure the integrity and security of financial transactions
5. **Security Auditing & Reporting**: Conduct regular security audits and generate compliance reports

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Implement robust compliance controls for standards like PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and ISO 27001
- Design and integrate machine learning-based fraud detection systems for real-time analysis
- Ensure end-to-end encryption and integrity checks for all financial transactions
- Establish continuous security monitoring, logging, and alerting for financial systems
- Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate security weaknesses

## Execution Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: Validate and process $ARGUMENTS
2. **Core Execution**: Execute main command logic
3. **Output Generation**: Generate structured results
