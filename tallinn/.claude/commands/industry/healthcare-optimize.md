# Healthcare industry optimization with HIPAA compliance, regulatory frameworks, and patient data security

**Usage**: `/healthcare-optimize $DOMAIN $COMPLIANCE`

## Key Arguments

- **$DOMAIN** (optional): Healthcare domain (clinical, administrative, research)
- **$COMPLIANCE** (optional): Compliance level (basic, advanced, comprehensive)

## Examples

```bash
/industry healthcare-optimize systems --hipaa
```

2. **Regulatory Mapping**: Map applicable regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, FDA, etc.)
3. **Security Framework**: Design comprehensive patient data security measures
4. **Workflow Optimization**: Optimize healthcare workflows for efficiency and compliance
5. **Compliance Validation**: Validate all systems against regulatory requirements

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Implement HIPAA-compliant data handling and storage
- Design secure patient data access controls and audit trails
- Create healthcare-specific workflows and validation processes
- Establish regulatory compliance monitoring and reporting
- Implement healthcare interoperability standards (HL7, FHIR)
- Design patient privacy and consent management systems

## Execution Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: Validate and process $ARGUMENTS
2. **Core Execution**: Execute main command logic
