# Advanced agent spawning with intelligent orchestration, capability matching, and dynamic scaling

**Usage**: `/agent-spawn $AGENT_TYPE $SPECIALIZATION $RESOURCE_LIMITS`

## Key Arguments

- **$AGENT_TYPE** (required): Type of specialized agent to spawn from available agent catalog.
- **$SPECIALIZATION** (optional): Specific specialization within the agent type.
- **$RESOURCE_LIMITS** (optional): Token budget and resource constraints for the agent.

## Examples

```bash
/agent spawn security-specialist threat-modeling
```
*Spawn a specialized security agent for threat modeling.*

```bash
/agent spawn swarm-coordinator max_agents=100
```
*Create a swarm coordinator for managing 100+ agents.*

 **CORE SPECIALIST AGENTS** (
**30k tokens each)

 <code_analysis_agent**:

 **Role**: Deep code understanding and pattern recognition specialist
 **Capabilities**:
 - Advanced static code analysis and pattern detection
 - Architectural review and design pattern identification
 - Code quality assessment and improvement recommendations
 - Legacy code analysis and modernization planning
 - Cross-language code understanding and translation
 
 **Specializations**: 
 - language-expert (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust)
 - pattern-detector (design patterns, anti-patterns, code smells)
 - architecture-analyzer (microservices, monoliths, serverless)
 - legacy-modernizer (COBOL, Fortran, mainframe migration)
