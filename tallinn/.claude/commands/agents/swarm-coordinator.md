# Meta-coordinator for managing 100+ agents simultaneously with hierarchical coordination

**Usage**: `/swarm-coordinator $MAX_AGENTS $COORDINATION_STRATEGY $LOAD_BALANCING`

## Key Arguments

- **$MAX_AGENTS** (optional): Maximum number of agents to coordinate simultaneously.
- **$COORDINATION_STRATEGY** (optional): Coordination strategy: hierarchical, peer-to-peer, or hybrid.
- **$LOAD_BALANCING** (optional): Load balancing approach: dynamic, round-robin, or capability-based.
