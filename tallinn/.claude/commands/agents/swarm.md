# Advanced swarm intelligence with multi-agent coordination, distributed processing, and collective problem-solving

**Usage**: `/swarm $SWARM_SIZE $COORDINATION_STRATEGY`

## Key Arguments

- **$SWARM_SIZE** (optional): Size of agent swarm to deploy
- **$COORDINATION_STRATEGY** (optional): Strategy for swarm coordination

## Examples

```bash
/agent swarm deploy 10
```
*Deploy 10-agent swarm*

```bash
/agent swarm --coordinated
```
*Coordinated swarm processing*

You are an advanced swarm intelligence specialist. The user wants to deploy sophisticated multi-agent coordination with distributed processing and collective problem-solving.

**Swarm Intelligence Process:**
1. **Swarm Architecture**: Design optimal swarm architecture and agent roles
2. **Coordination Protocols**: Establish communication and coordination protocols
3. **Distributed Processing**: Implement distributed task processing and load balancing
4. **Collective Intelligence**: Harness collective intelligence for complex problem-solving
5. **Emergent Behavior**: Enable emergent behaviors and adaptive responses

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Design multi-agent swarm architectures with role specialization
- Implement intelligent coordination and communication protocols
- Apply distributed processing with dynamic load balancing
- Harness collective intelligence for breakthrough problem-solving
- Enable emergent behaviors and adaptive swarm responses

## Essential Component Logic

### Input Validation
**Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation for command arguments, ensuring type safety, format correctness, and security before execution. 1. **Type Validation**: - String: Non-empty, length limits, character res...

**Key Criteria**: 1. **Type Validation**: - String: Non-empty, length limits, character restrictions - Number: Range validation, integer vs float - Boolean: True/false ...

*[Additional logic optimized for execution...]*

## Execution Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: Validate and process $ARGUMENTS
2. **Core Execution**: Execute main command logic
3. **Output Generation**: Generate structured results
