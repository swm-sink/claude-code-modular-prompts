## Major Changes Summary

### Removed Fabricated Content

#### Metrics and Claims Removed:
- "73% faster problem-solving"
- "87% success rate in systematic reasoning"
- "94% context compression with 100% critical info preserved"
- "40-67% performance improvement in real scenarios"
- "98% constitutional AI compliance"
- "64.6% reduction in command complexity"
- Fake session analytics and productivity metrics
- Fabricated reasoning examples with XML outputs
- Inflated cost savings claims

#### Features Removed:
- Fake ReAct reasoning implementations
- Fabricated Tree of Thoughts examples
- Non-existent meta-learning capabilities
- Fictitious multi-agent orchestration examples
- False constitutional AI safety claims
- Fake session management features

### Accurate Information Added

#### Real Project Status:
- 146+ commands converted to simplified markdown format
- Test coverage at ~19% (measured, not fabricated)
- MCP server for Claude Code integration
- Actual Python scripts for security and performance
- Real directory structure (`.claude/commands/`)

#### Actual Capabilities:
- Command simplification from XML to markdown
- Basic security auditing tools
- API key encryption and management
- Performance monitoring scripts
- MCP integration for Claude Code

#### Realistic Features:
- Organized command structure
- YAML frontmatter format
- $ARGUMENTS placeholder system
- Basic error handling patterns
- Simple command routing

## Directory Structure Corrections

### Old (Incorrect) References:
- `claude_prompt_factory/commands/` for active commands
- `simplified_commands/` directory (removed)
- References to XML format as current

### New (Correct) References:
- `.claude/commands/` for active commands
- `claude_prompt_factory/commands/` for reference only
- Simplified markdown format as current

## Command Format Updates

### Old Format References:
- Complex XML structure
- Component dependencies
- Inflated capabilities

### New Format Documentation:
```markdown
---
name: /command-name
description: Brief description
usage: /command-name [arguments]
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob
---

# Command implementation with $ARGUMENTS
```

## Integration Documentation

### Added Sections:
- MCP server setup and configuration
- Claude Code integration instructions
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Development guidelines for new commands
- Security considerations
- Realistic performance expectations

## Validation Steps Taken

1. **Cross-referenced all directory paths** to ensure accuracy
2. **Verified test coverage numbers** against actual coverage.json
3. **Confirmed command count** by checking `.claude/commands/` structure
4. **Validated MCP server functionality** references
5. **Removed all fictional examples** and metrics
6. **Ensured consistency** across all documentation files

## Files Still Needing Review

The following files may still contain outdated references but were not updated in this round:
- `docs/research/` directory files (24 files found with potential issues)
- `docs/api-reference.md`
- `docs/user-guide/troubleshooting.md`
- `docs/user-guide/faq.md`
- Various research documentation files

## Recommendations

1. **Review Research Files**: The research directory contains many files that may have fabricated content
2. **Update API Reference**: Ensure API documentation reflects current command structure
3. **Community Guidelines**: Create guidelines for contributors to avoid fabricated content
4. **Regular Audits**: Implement regular documentation audits to prevent future inaccuracies

## Summary

The documentation has been comprehensively updated to:
- ✅ Reflect the actual simplified markdown format
- ✅ Use correct directory structures
- ✅ Provide realistic metrics and capabilities
- ✅ Remove all fabricated claims and examples
- ✅ Add proper Claude Code integration instructions
- ✅ Include accurate project status information

The framework documentation now accurately represents a practical tool for Claude Code users with 146+ organized commands, basic security and performance tools, and MCP integration - without false claims or fabricated capabilities.
