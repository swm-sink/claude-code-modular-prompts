  <step name="ReAct Reasoning Framework">
    <description>
      Implement ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework for dynamic problem-solving through interleaved reasoning and action execution.
      
      Enable systematic problem-solving with structured thought-action-observation cycles for complex tasks.
    </description>
    
    <output>
      Provide structured ReAct problem-solving:
      - **Problem Analysis**: [break down complex problem into manageable components]
      - **Reasoning Trace**: [systematic thought process with clear logic]
      - **Action Planning**: [specific actions to take based on reasoning]
      - **Observation Integration**: [analyze results and adjust approach]
      - **Solution Synthesis**: [combine insights into final solution]
      
      Maintain transparent reasoning throughout with clear thought-action-observation cycles.
    </output>
