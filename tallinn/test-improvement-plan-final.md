2. **After each module test completion**
3. **Before integration test changes**
4. **At each coverage milestone**

#### Feature Flags
```python
FEATURE_FLAGS = {
    'new_test_framework': False,
    'async_test_utils': False,
    'mutation_testing': False,
    'parallel_execution': False
}
```

2. **Over-mocking internal methods**
3. **Missing error path tests**
4. **Incorrect async test patterns**
5. **Test naming inconsistencies**

#### Documentation Updates
Every 5 mistakes triggers:
1. Update to CLAUDE.md with patterns
2. Addition to test guidelines
3. Team knowledge sharing session
4. Automated lint rule if possible

### Success Metrics and Milestones

   - Fallback: Hybrid XML/Markdown support

2. **Team Skill Gaps**
   - Mitigation: Built-in training time
   - Fallback: External consultants identified

3. **Timeline Pressure**
   - Mitigation: 12-week realistic timeline
   - Fallback: Prioritized module list

4. **Quality Compromise**
   - Mitigation: Mutation testing throughout
   - Fallback: 90% quality target acceptable

### Conclusion

This refined plan provides a realistic, sustainable path to 95% test coverage through:

1. **Adequate preparation** time for architectural improvements
2. **Incremental progress** with continuous validation
3. **Quality focus** through mutation testing and reviews
4. **Team development** alongside coverage improvement
5. **Sustainable practices** that ensure long-term success

The 12-week timeline accounts for real-world complexity while maintaining momentum toward the ambitious 95% coverage goal.
