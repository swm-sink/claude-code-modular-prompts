## üèóÔ∏è Development Process

### Branch Strategy
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
git checkout -b docs/documentation-improvement
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Create Your Development Branch**
2. **Make Your Changes** (see specific guides below)
3. **Test Your Changes** using framework commands
4. **Update Documentation** if needed
5. **Submit Pull Request** with clear description

### Framework-Specific Development

#### Adding New Commands
1. **Create Command File**
   ```bash
   # Create in appropriate category directory
   claude_prompt_factory/commands/[category]/your-command.md
   ```

2. **Use Command Template**
   ```markdown
   # Your Command Name
   
   ## Purpose
   Brief description of what this command does
   
   ## Usage
   `/your-command "description"`
   
   ## Implementation
   [Implementation details using framework patterns]
   ```

3. **Test Your Command**
   ```bash
   # Test the new command
   /your-command "test implementation"
   
   # Validate it follows framework patterns
   /meta-review "analyze new command implementation"
   ```

#### Adding New Components
1. **Create Component File**
   ```bash
   claude_prompt_factory/components/[category]/your-component.md
   ```

   ## Purpose
   Component functionality description
   
   ## Interface
   Input/output specifications
   
   ## Implementation
   [Detailed implementation following framework patterns]
   ```

3. **Add Component Integration**
   - Update relevant command files to use the component
   - Test integration with existing commands

#### Framework Architecture Principles
- **Modularity**: Components should be self-contained and reusable
- **Constitutional AI**: All additions must follow ethical guidelines
- **Quality Gates**: Maintain TDD and quality standards
- **Documentation**: Every addition needs comprehensive documentation
- **Testing**: Include test cases and validation

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Testing Your Changes
1. **Command Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test individual commands

   ```bash
   # Test with different project types
   /session-create "test-session" --type testing
   # Test your changes in the session
   /session-save --analytics true
   ```

3. **Quality Validation**
   ```bash
   # Run framework validation
   python scripts/analyze_component_usage.py
   ```
