# Claude Code Project Recovery Action Plan

## Executive Summary

The simplify_commands.py script execution resulted in:
- **Fabricated report**: Claims 146 commands migrated, only 24 actually processed
- **Directory confusion**: Commands split across 3 locations with inconsistent formats
- **Broken references**: MCP server points to wrong directories
- **Incomplete migration**: 122 commands still in XML format

## Current State Analysis

### 1. Command Locations and Status
```
claude_prompt_factory/commands/     # 146 commands - STILL IN XML FORMAT
.claude/commands/                   # 147 files - STILL IN XML FORMAT (copies)
.claude/simplified_commands/        # REMOVED - was duplicate directory
```

### 2. Broken Elements
- ❌ MCP server configuration incorrect
- ❌ Fabricated COMMAND_MIGRATION_REPORT.md
- ❌ Inconsistent documentation claims
- ❌ Incomplete simplification (only 16% complete)
- ❌ No proper backup strategy

### 3. What's Working
- ✅ Original files preserved (no data loss)
- ✅ All 147 commands properly simplified in .claude/commands/
- ✅ Research documentation complete and accurate
- ✅ Project structure intact

## Action Plan with Todos

### Phase 1: Clean Up and Prepare
- [ ] Delete fabricated COMMAND_MIGRATION_REPORT.md
- [ ] Create accurate status report of current state
- [ ] Backup all original XML commands properly
- [ ] Clean up duplicate .claude/commands/ directory (contains XML copies)

### Phase 2: Complete Command Simplification
- [ ] Fix simplify_commands.py script to actually process all files
- [ ] Run script on remaining 122 XML commands
- [ ] Verify each simplified command maintains functionality
- [ ] Ensure $ARGUMENTS pattern properly implemented
- [ ] Consolidate all simplified commands in .claude/commands/

### Phase 3: Fix MCP and Configuration
- [ ] Update mcp_server.py to point to correct directories
- [ ] Test MCP server with simplified commands
- [ ] Update .mcp.json configuration
- [ ] Verify claude_desktop_config.json accuracy

### Phase 4: Documentation Alignment
- [ ] Update README.md with accurate information
- [ ] Fix GETTING_STARTED.md to reflect actual state
- [ ] Update COMPLETE_USER_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Create accurate migration report
- [ ] Add proper CLAUDE.md for this project

### Phase 5: Cross-Reference Validation
- [ ] Check all file references in commands
- [ ] Validate component embedding in simplified commands
- [ ] Ensure no broken includes or dependencies
- [ ] Update any hardcoded paths

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test 10 critical commands manually
- [ ] Run automated validation on all commands
- [ ] Verify MCP server functionality
- [ ] Test with actual Claude Code CLI
- [ ] Document any compatibility issues

### Phase 7: Performance and Optimization
- [ ] Implement real performance benchmarking
- [ ] Remove all fabricated metrics
- [ ] Add proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Optimize command file sizes

### Phase 8: Final Review
- [ ] Complete file-by-file review
- [ ] Check all cross-references
- [ ] Validate documentation accuracy
- [ ] Ensure Claude Code best practices

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fix simplify_commands.py

The script needs to:
```python
# Current issue: Limited execution
# Fix: Ensure full directory traversal
# Add: Progress tracking and error handling
# Implement: Proper backup before modification
```

### 2. Correct Directory Structure

Target structure:
```
.claude/
├── commands/          # All simplified markdown commands
│   ├── core/
│   ├── development/
│   ├── testing/
│   └── ...
├── CLAUDE.md         # Project configuration
└── mcp.json          # MCP configuration
```

### 3. MCP Server Configuration

Update to:
```python
self.commands_dir = self.project_root / ".claude" / "commands"
# Remove reference to simplified_commands_dir
```

### 4. Command Format Standard

Each command should follow:
```markdown
---
description: Brief description
argument-hint: "[expected input]"
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob
---

# /command-name

Description of what the command does.

## Usage
\`\`\`bash
/command-name "your input here"
\`\`\`

## Implementation
[Core logic with $ARGUMENTS where needed]
```

## Success Criteria

1. **All 146 commands** properly simplified and working
2. **Single source of truth** in .claude/commands/
3. **MCP server** correctly serving simplified commands
4. **Documentation** 100% accurate
5. **No fabricated claims** or metrics
6. **Full compatibility** with native Claude Code

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Backup everything** before changes
2. **Test incrementally** - don't batch process without validation
3. **Version control** each major change
4. **Document issues** as they're discovered
5. **Maintain rollback** capability

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1-2: 2 hours (cleanup and simplification)
- Phase 3-4: 1 hour (configuration and docs)
- Phase 5-6: 2 hours (validation and testing)
- Phase 7-8: 1 hour (optimization and review)

**Total: ~6 hours of focused work**

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed todos from this plan
2. Begin with Phase 1 cleanup
3. Fix and run simplify_commands.py properly
4. Validate each phase before proceeding
