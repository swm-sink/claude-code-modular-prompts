   - High cyclomatic complexity (>10)
   - Large line count (>50 lines)
   - Deep nesting (>4 levels)
   - High parameter count (>5)

2. **TDD Refactoring Process**:
   - Write comprehensive tests first
   - Ensure green tests before refactoring
   - Apply Single Responsibility Principle
   - Extract helper methods
   - Verify tests remain green
   - Achieve >85% test coverage

3. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Before/after complexity measurements
   - Test coverage improvements
   - Performance impact assessment
