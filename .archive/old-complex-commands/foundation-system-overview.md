# Deep Discovery Foundation System Overview

## Five Foundation Commands for 30-60 Minute Consultation

The deep discovery consultation system is built on five foundation commands that work together to provide comprehensive project intelligence through depth and quality over speed.

### 1. `/deep-discovery` - Master Orchestrator
**Purpose**: Coordinates the complete 30-60 minute consultation experience
**Key Features**:
- Manages all phases: research (15-20 min), consultation (20-30 min), generation (10-15 min)
- Provides session management with pause/resume capability
- User control and approval at every critical decision point
- References the 8-phase deep discovery architecture

**Usage**: 
- `deep-discovery start` - Begin complete consultation
- `deep-discovery resume` - Continue from checkpoint
- `deep-discovery status` - Check progress
- `deep-discovery phases` - Review all phases

### 2. `/research-patterns` - Evidence-Based Pattern Analysis
**Purpose**: Web research and pattern analysis engine for validated insights
**Key Features**:
- Analyzes 20+ leading repositories in detected technology stack
- CRAAP test framework for source validation (Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, Purpose)
- Evidence-based pattern database creation
- Zero hallucination enforcement with 3+ source requirement

**Usage**:
- `research-patterns analyze` - Comprehensive stack analysis
- `research-patterns validate` - Pattern validation with confidence scoring
- `research-patterns database` - Query pattern database
- `research-patterns report` - Research summary generation

### 3. `/consult-interactive` - Smart Questions Framework
**Purpose**: Interactive 20-30 minute consultation for deep project understanding
**Key Features**:
- Smart, valuable questions (NOT zero questions)
- Domain expertise extraction through strategic questioning
- Project DNA capture: technical architecture, team dynamics, vision
- Context-aware question selection based on previous answers

**Usage**:
- `consult-interactive start` - Begin 20-30 minute consultation
- `consult-interactive continue` - Resume from checkpoint
- `consult-interactive review` - See captured project DNA
- `consult-interactive export` - Prepare for context generation

### 4. `/generate-context` - Multi-File Context Engineering
**Purpose**: Creates sophisticated hierarchical context systems
**Key Features**:
- 5-layer hierarchical context architecture (foundation, domain, technical, workflow, agents)
- Token-optimized context loading strategies
- Before/after effectiveness testing
- Context validation framework with measurable improvements

**Usage**:
- `generate-context design` - Architecture design with user approval
- `generate-context create` - Multi-file context system creation
- `generate-context validate` - Effectiveness testing
- `generate-context optimize` - Performance optimization

### 5. `/develop-agents` - Real Agent Development Platform
**Purpose**: Creates genuinely specialized agents with real capabilities
**Key Features**:
- REAL specialized agents (not templates)
- Domain Expert, Technical Architect, Code Reviewer, Debugging agents
- Agent orchestration protocols and coordination
- Measurable expertise validation

**Usage**:
- `develop-agents design` - Agent specialization design
- `develop-agents create` - Real agent implementation
- `develop-agents deploy` - Agent system deployment
- `develop-agents monitor` - Performance monitoring

## System Integration Flow

### Phase 1: Research & Foundation (15-20 minutes)
```
/deep-discovery start
├── Framework detection and analysis
├── /research-patterns analyze
│   ├── 20+ repository analysis
│   ├── CRAAP test validation
│   └── Pattern database creation
└── Foundation established for consultation
```

### Phase 2: Interactive Consultation (20-30 minutes)
```
/consult-interactive start
├── Domain intelligence extraction
├── Architecture reasoning analysis
├── Team workflow understanding
├── Pain points and success patterns
└── Strategic vision alignment
```

### Phase 3: Context Engineering (10-15 minutes)
```
/generate-context design → create → validate
├── 5-layer hierarchical context architecture
├── Multi-file context system creation
├── Token optimization and loading strategies
└── Effectiveness testing and validation
```

### Phase 4: Agent Development (5-10 minutes)
```
/develop-agents design → create → deploy
├── Specialized agent capability definition
├── Real agent implementation with project DNA
├── Agent orchestration and coordination setup
└── Agent effectiveness validation
```

## User Control Throughout Process

**Session Management**:
- Pause/resume at any point across all commands
- Progress tracking and checkpoint system
- State persistence in `.claude-architect/`

**Interactive Approval**:
- User approval required for all major decisions
- Ability to modify and customize all generated content
- Control over which phases to execute

**Quality Validation**:
- Before/after testing for context effectiveness
- Agent capability validation through testing
- User satisfaction confirmation at each phase

## Success Criteria

The foundation system succeeds when:
1. **Research Phase**: Evidence-based patterns identified and validated
2. **Consultation Phase**: Comprehensive project DNA captured through smart questions
3. **Context Phase**: Multi-file hierarchical context system created and validated effective
4. **Agent Phase**: Real specialized agents deployed with measurable expertise
5. **Integration**: All components work together seamlessly with user control

## Key Differentiators from Failed Approaches

**Depth over Speed**:
- 30-60 minutes comprehensive vs 30 seconds superficial
- Smart questions vs zero questions
- Evidence-based patterns vs assumptions
- Real agents vs template theater

**Quality over Convenience**:
- User approval at every decision point
- Effectiveness testing and validation
- Session management for thorough completion
- Measurable improvements in Claude responses

**Intelligence over Templates**:
- Project DNA extraction and understanding
- Context engineering for genuine specialization
- Agent development with real capabilities
- Continuous validation and improvement
