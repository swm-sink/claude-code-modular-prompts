# Workflow Pattern Consultation: Team Collaboration & Development Process Discovery

## Purpose
This command provides focused team workflow consultation (7-10 minutes) that extracts deep understanding of your team's development processes, collaboration patterns, coding standards, and quality practices. Designed as both a standalone consultation and cross-cutting analysis for the full consultation flow.

## üéØ What This Consultation Discovers

**Development Workflow Intelligence:**
- Development lifecycle and process patterns (agile, waterfall, hybrid)
- Code review processes, approval workflows, and quality gates
- Branch strategies, deployment patterns, and release cycles
- Team collaboration tools and communication patterns

**Quality & Standards Understanding:**
- Coding standards, style guides, and formatting preferences
- Documentation requirements and knowledge sharing practices
- Testing strategies, coverage requirements, and quality metrics
- Error handling, logging, and monitoring conventions

**Team Dynamics & Preferences:**
- Team size, structure, and role responsibilities
- Decision-making processes and technical leadership patterns
- Tool preferences and workflow automation
- Learning culture and knowledge transfer approaches

## üìã Consultation Process

### Phase 1: Development Process Discovery (2-3 minutes)
**Process Pattern Recognition:**
- Development methodology and sprint/iteration patterns
- Code review and approval workflow requirements
- Branch strategy and merge/deployment patterns
- Release cycle and deployment frequency preferences

**Intelligent Process Questioning:**
- "I see GitHub Actions workflows. Are you doing continuous deployment or scheduled releases?"
- "Multiple branch protection rules suggest team development. What's your review process?"
- "Semantic versioning in your tags. How do you handle breaking changes and migration?"

### Phase 2: Quality Standards & Conventions (3-4 minutes)
**Standards Pattern Analysis:**
- Code formatting and linting rule preferences
- Documentation standards and comment conventions
- Testing requirements and coverage expectations
- Error handling and logging pattern preferences

**Adaptive Standards Discovery:**
- For TypeScript: "Do you prefer explicit types or type inference? Strict mode enabled?"
- For Python: "PEP 8 compliance or custom style guide? Type hints required or optional?"
- For Documentation: "Inline comments, README-driven, or wiki documentation preferred?"

### Phase 3: Team Collaboration & Tool Integration (2-3 minutes)
**Collaboration Pattern Understanding:**
- Team size and distributed/co-located work patterns
- Communication preferences (async, real-time, documentation-first)
- Knowledge sharing and mentoring approaches
- Tool ecosystem and integration preferences

**Context-Aware Team Questions:**
- Small teams: "How do you handle knowledge sharing and cross-training?"
- Large teams: "What's your process for architectural decisions and standards enforcement?"
- Distributed teams: "How do you maintain code quality and communication across time zones?"

### Integration with Full Consultation
- Workflow findings influence technical and domain consultations
- Process preferences inform context generation and command customization
- Team patterns shape Claude's communication style and suggestion approach
- Progress tracked within overall consultation workflow

### User Control Throughout Process
- **Navigation**: `skip`, `back`, `skip section` commands available
- **Pace Control**: Switch between quick/standard/comprehensive modes mid-session
- **Clarification**: `clarify`, `example`, `more detail` for deeper process understanding
- **Validation**: `review`, `summary` to confirm workflow understanding

## üí° Interactive Dialogue Examples

### Development Process Discovery Dialogue:
```
‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Analysis: Development Process Discovery

I've analyzed your repository and found process indicators:
- GitHub Actions with PR-based triggers
- Branch protection rules requiring reviews
- Semantic versioning and release tags
- Issue templates and project boards

Let me understand your specific development workflow:

1. Development Cycle: Are you using agile/scrum, feature-driven development, 
   or a custom process? How long are your typical development cycles?

2. Code Review Process: What's required for code approval? How many reviewers? 
   Any automated checks that must pass before merge?

3. Release Strategy: How often do you deploy? Is it automated after merge, 
   or do you have scheduled release windows?

[User provides workflow-specific context that builds process understanding]
```

### Quality Standards Exploration:
```
üìè Quality Standards & Conventions Analysis

Based on your configuration files, I can see:
- ESLint/Prettier for JavaScript formatting
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Jest testing configuration
- Husky pre-commit hooks

Let's understand your quality preferences:

1. Code Style: Are you strict about the current ESLint rules, or are there 
   areas where you're more flexible? Any team-specific conventions?

2. Documentation: What level of documentation do you expect? Inline comments, 
   JSDoc, README updates, or architectural decision records?

3. Testing Philosophy: Do you aim for high coverage, focus on critical paths, 
   or emphasize integration vs unit testing?

[Dialogue adapts based on detected tooling and project maturity]
```

### Team Collaboration Pattern Discovery:
```
üë• Team Collaboration & Communication Analysis

I want to understand how your team works together:

1. Team Structure: How many developers? Are you co-located, distributed, or 
   hybrid? Any specialized roles (frontend, backend, DevOps)?

2. Decision Making: How do architectural decisions get made? Technical lead, 
   team consensus, or formal RFC process?

3. Knowledge Sharing: How do you handle code reviews, mentoring, and 
   knowledge transfer? Pair programming, documentation, or informal discussion?

4. Communication Style: Do you prefer detailed written explanations, concise 
   summaries, or interactive discussion for technical topics?

[Builds understanding of team dynamics that inform Claude's interaction style]
```
