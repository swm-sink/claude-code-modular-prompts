# Domain Intelligence Consultation: Business Context & Workflow Discovery

## Purpose
This command provides focused business domain consultation (7-10 minutes) that extracts deep understanding of your project's business domain, terminology, user workflows, and domain-specific patterns. Designed as both a standalone consultation and Stage 3 of the full consultation flow.

## üéØ What This Consultation Discovers

**Business Domain Intelligence:**
- Industry context and domain-specific terminology
- Core business entities, relationships, and data models
- Business rules, constraints, and compliance requirements
- Domain expertise areas and specialized knowledge needs

**User Journey Mapping:**
- Primary user personas and their workflow patterns
- Critical user journeys and interaction flows
- Pain points, optimization opportunities, and success metrics
- User experience patterns and interface conventions

**Data & Integration Patterns:**
- Core data entities and their relationships
- External integrations, APIs, and service dependencies
- Data flow patterns and business process automation
- Reporting, analytics, and business intelligence needs

## üìã Consultation Process

### Phase 1: Domain Context Discovery (2-3 minutes)
**Industry & Business Model Analysis:**
- Business domain identification (e-commerce, fintech, healthcare, etc.)
- Target market and customer segments
- Business model patterns (SaaS, marketplace, content, etc.)
- Regulatory or compliance considerations

**Intelligent Domain Questioning:**
- "I see payment processing code. Are you building for B2B, B2C, or both?"
- "Healthcare terminology in your models suggests HIPAA considerations. What's your compliance scope?"
- "E-commerce patterns detected. Are you handling inventory, orders, or payments directly?"

### Phase 2: Business Entity & Workflow Exploration (3-4 minutes)
**Core Business Logic Understanding:**
- Primary business entities (users, products, orders, projects, etc.)
- Entity relationships and business rule constraints
- Workflow patterns and business process flows
- State management and status transitions

**Adaptive Business Rule Discovery:**
- For E-commerce: "What's your product catalog structure? Do you handle variants, bundles, or subscriptions?"
- For Project Management: "How do you track project progress? Are there approval workflows or milestone gates?"
- For SaaS: "What's your user onboarding flow? Do you have different tiers or feature access patterns?"

### Phase 3: User Experience & Integration Context (2-3 minutes)
**User Journey Intelligence:**
- Primary user flows and success paths
- User types and permission/access patterns
- Key user actions and decision points
- User experience optimization priorities

**Integration & Data Context:**
- External service integrations (payments, email, analytics, etc.)
- Data import/export requirements and formats
- Reporting and analytics requirements
- Third-party API dependencies and patterns

## üöÄ Three Consultation Modes

### Quick Mode (5-7 minutes)
**Essential Domain Understanding:**
- Core business domain and primary use case
- Key business entities and basic relationships
- Primary user workflow and main success path
- Critical integrations or compliance requirements

### Standard Mode (7-10 minutes) - Default
**Comprehensive Domain Profile:**

- Full entity relationship mapping and business rules
- Multiple user journeys and workflow patterns
- Integration patterns and data flow understanding

### Comprehensive Mode (10-15 minutes)
**Deep Domain Consultation:**
- Advanced business rule exploration and edge cases
- Complex workflow analysis and optimization opportunities
- Detailed compliance and regulatory requirement discussion

## üîÑ Session Management Integration

### Pause/Resume Support
- Save domain discovery progress with `/manage-session-state pause`

### Integration with Full Consultation
- Can be run standalone or as part of `/begin-consultation`
- Domain findings inform technical decisions and context generation

## üí° Interactive Dialogue Examples

### Business Domain Discovery Dialogue:
```
üè¢ Domain Intelligence: Business Context Discovery

I've analyzed your codebase and found business-related patterns:
- User authentication and role management
- Payment processing integration (Stripe)
- Email notification system
- Order/invoice generation

Let me understand your specific business domain:

1. Business Model: Are you building a SaaS platform, e-commerce site, or 
   marketplace? What's your primary revenue model?

2. Target Users: Who are your primary users? Are they businesses, consumers, 
   or internal teams? What's their technical expertise level?

3. Core Value Proposition: What's the main problem you're solving? What 
   success looks like for your users?

[User provides domain-specific context that builds business understanding]
```

### Business Entity Exploration:
```
üìä Business Logic Analysis

Based on your database models and API endpoints, I can see:
- User management with roles/permissions
- Product or service catalog structure
- Transaction/order processing workflow
- Notification and communication system

Let's map your business logic:

1. Core Entities: What are your main business objects? How do they relate 
   to each other? (e.g., Users ‚Üí Orders ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Inventory)

2. Business Rules: What are the key constraints? (e.g., "Orders can't be 
   cancelled after shipping", "Users need approval for premium features")

3. Workflow States: What are the key status transitions? (e.g., 
   draft ‚Üí review ‚Üí approved ‚Üí published for content workflows)

[Dialogue adapts based on detected business patterns and domain type]
```

### User Journey Mapping:
```
üë• User Experience Flow Analysis

I want to understand your users' journey through your application:

1. User Onboarding: How do new users get started? Is there a setup process,
   tutorial, or guided first-time experience?

2. Primary Actions: What are the 3-5 most important things users do in your
   application? What does a "successful session" look like?

3. User Types: Do you have different user types with different permissions
   or workflows? (Admin, regular user, guest, etc.)

4. Success Metrics: How do you measure user success? What indicates that
   users are getting value from your platform?

[Builds understanding of user patterns that inform UX-aware code suggestions]
```
