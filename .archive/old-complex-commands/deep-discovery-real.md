# Deep Discovery (Real Implementation)

## What This ACTUALLY Does

This command performs a real 30-60 minute consultation that:
1. **Analyzes** your actual project files
2. **Discovers** your specific patterns
3. **Generates** working commands tailored to your project
4. **Validates** that everything works

No templates. No placeholders. Real, working commands.

## The ACTUAL Implementation

### Phase 1: Technical Analysis (10-15 minutes)

```python
# This is what actually happens:

1. Framework Detection:
   framework = Read('package.json') or Read('requirements.txt') or Read('go.mod')
   
2. Structure Analysis:
   structure = LS('.') then Glob('**/*.{js,ts,py,go}')
   
3. Pattern Detection:
   patterns = Grep('import|require|from', '**/*.{js,ts,py}')
   naming = analyze_file_names(Glob('**/*'))
   
4. Test Analysis:
   tests = Glob('**/*.{test,spec}.*')
   test_framework = detect_from_imports(tests)
```

### Phase 2: Interactive Consultation (15-20 minutes)

```markdown
# Real questions based on discoveries:

"I detected React 18.2 with TypeScript. Is this correct?"
"I see you use kebab-case for files. Should generated commands follow this?"
"You have 47% test coverage. Should new components include tests?"
"I found both .tsx and .jsx files. Which should I use?"
```

### Phase 3: Command Generation (10-15 minutes)

```python
# ACTUAL generation that happens:

for pattern in discovered_patterns:
    if pattern.type == 'component':
        command = create_component_command(
            naming=pattern.naming,
            structure=pattern.structure,
            imports=pattern.imports,
            testing=pattern.testing
        )
        Write(f'.claude/commands/{command.name}.md', command.content)
```

### Phase 4: Validation (5-10 minutes)

```bash
# Test each generated command:
for command in generated_commands:
    test_result = execute_command_dry_run(command)
    if test_result.failed:
        fix_and_retry(command)
```

## Example: What ACTUALLY Gets Generated

### For a Real Next.js + TypeScript Project

After analyzing YOUR project, this command would generate:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/create-page.md
---
name: create-page
description: Create a Next.js page with your exact setup
usage: "create-page <name>"
allowed-tools: [Write, Read, MultiEdit]
---

# Create Next.js Page

This command creates pages matching YOUR project:
- Uses `/app` directory (detected App Router)
- TypeScript with your tsconfig settings
- Your Tailwind classes
- Your layout.tsx wrapper
- Your metadata pattern

## Implementation

When you run `/create-page about`, it will:

1. Create `app/about/page.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // Your actual import pattern
   import { Metadata } from 'next'
   import { Container } from '@/components/ui/Container'
   
   export const metadata: Metadata = {
     title: 'About - YourApp',
     description: 'About page'
   }
   
   export default function AboutPage() {
     return (
       <Container>
         <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">About</h1>
       </Container>
     )
   }
   ```

2. Create test file (because you test your pages):
   ```typescript
   // app/about/page.test.tsx
   import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
   import AboutPage from './page'
   
   describe('AboutPage', () => {
     it('renders the about page', () => {
       render(<AboutPage />)
       expect(screen.getByText('About')).toBeInTheDocument()
     })
   })
   ```
```

## The Key Difference

### Old Approach (Templates)
```markdown
Create component at [COMPONENT_PATH]/[COMPONENT_NAME].[EXTENSION]
Using [FRAMEWORK] patterns with [TEST_FRAMEWORK]
```

### New Approach (Actual Generation)
```markdown
Create component at src/components/Button.tsx
Using React 18.2 with TypeScript and your exact imports
Including your jest+RTL test setup
Following your team's exact patterns
```

## How to Use This

```bash
# Run the real deep discovery
/deep-discovery-real

# You'll see:
"üîç Analyzing your project structure..."
"üìä Found: Next.js 14.0.3, TypeScript, Tailwind, Jest"
"üí¨ Let me ask a few questions to understand your preferences..."

# Answer ~10 smart questions based on what was found

# Then:
"üöÄ Generating 12 commands tailored to your project..."
"‚úÖ Created: create-page, create-component, create-api-route..."
"üéâ Complete! Your commands are ready to use."

# Now you can immediately:
/create-page pricing
/create-component Button
/create-api-route users
# And they'll work EXACTLY like your team writes code
```

## Why This Works

1. **Uses Claude's Real Capabilities**: Read, Write, Grep - not imaginary engines
2. **Analyzes Actual Files**: Not theoretical patterns
3. **Generates Real Commands**: Not templates with placeholders
4. **Validates Everything**: Ensures it actually works
5. **Takes 30-60 Minutes**: But delivers immediate value

## Success Metrics

‚úÖ Commands work on first try
‚úÖ Match your exact patterns
‚úÖ No manual customization needed
‚úÖ Save hours of setup time
‚úÖ Team consistency improved

This is what we should be building. Not YAML configurations. Not template libraries. Real, working command generation based on actual project analysis.
