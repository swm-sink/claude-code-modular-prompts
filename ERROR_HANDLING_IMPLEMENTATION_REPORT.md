### Technical Implementation Details

#### Error Classification System
```xml
<error_types>
  <BLOCKING>Critical failures requiring immediate stop</BLOCKING>
  <CONDITIONAL>Warnings allowing conditional continuation</CONDITIONAL>
  <OPTIONAL>Minor issues not impacting core functionality</OPTIONAL>
  <ESCALATION>Complex issues requiring human intervention</ESCALATION>
</error_types>
```

#### Recovery Strategy Matrix
- **Transient Failures**: Exponential backoff, 3 attempts max
- **Resource Contention**: Linear backoff with monitoring, 5 attempts max  
- **Component Failures**: Isolation and alternative implementation
- **Integration Failures**: Progressive rollback with interface validation
- **Security Violations**: Immediate stop with forensic preservation

#### Monitoring Metrics
