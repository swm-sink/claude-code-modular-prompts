# Claude Context Architect - Session Tracking
# This file tracks the current transformation session
# Git-ignored for privacy, used for session state only

## Current Session
- **Session ID**: transform-2025-01-09-001
- **Started**: 2025-01-09T18:00:00Z
- **Phase**: PLANNING COMPLETE
- **Status**: All documentation updated, ready for Phase 1

## Session State
```yaml
current_task: "Phase 1 Assessment & Validation COMPLETE"
last_completed: "Mapped dependencies - found ZERO integration"
next_action: "Begin Phase 2 - Value Extraction & Preservation"
validation_count: 4  # Commands tested, anti-patterns validated, YAMLs analyzed, dependencies mapped
web_searches_performed: 2  # Hallucination patterns, prompt engineering best practices
files_modified: 5  # Added claude.local.md update
phases_completed: "Phase 1 (4 hours)"
phases_remaining: 6
```

## Validation Log
- [18:00] Validated current state: 1,772 files confirmed
- [18:05] Updated claude.todos.yaml to version 4.0
- [18:15] CLAUDE.md updated with vision and SSOT enforcement
- [18:20] Created technical-reality.md for Claude capabilities
- [18:25] Backup created: lisbon-backup-[timestamp]
- [18:26] Git checkpoint: pre-transformation-20250109
- [18:45] Completed full 7-phase transformation plan documentation
- [19:00] Phase 1: Tested 3 commands - ALL are just templates, NO functionality
- [19:15] Phase 1: Validated anti-patterns with web search - STILL RELEVANT
- [19:30] Phase 1: Identified 12 essential YAMLs from 84 backend files
- [19:45] Phase 1: CRITICAL - Found ZERO integration between frontend/backend

## Decision Points
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with new vision - COMPLETED
- [x] Create context consolidation - technical-reality.md CREATED
- [x] Backup before changes - COMPLETED
- [x] 30-60 minute consultation - CONFIRMED
- [x] 5 script limit - CONFIRMED
- [x] DELETE backend (not archive) - CONFIRMED
- [x] AGGRESSIVE transformation - CONFIRMED

## Notes
- Architectural mismatch confirmed: backend analyzes external repos, not user project
- SSOT structure defined and enforced
- DRY enforcement rules established
- User wants AGGRESSIVE changes, DELETE not archive
- 5 script hard limit to prevent proliferation

### Phase 1 Findings:
- **Commands**: 3 "simple" commands are just templates with no execution
- **Integration**: ZERO connection between frontend (.claude) and backend (.claude-architect)
- **Anti-patterns**: Web validation confirms all still relevant in 2025
- **Essential YAMLs**: 12 of 84 contain useful consultation/generation logic
- **Python files**: 109 scripts that don't connect anything
- **Next step**: Extract value from 12 YAMLs, DELETE everything else

## Checkpoints
- Pre-transformation state: CREATED (git tag + backup)
- Phase 1 ready: YES
- User approval: RECEIVED
