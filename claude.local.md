## Decision Points
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with new vision - COMPLETED
- [x] Create context consolidation - technical-reality.md CREATED
- [x] Backup before changes - COMPLETED
- [x] 30-60 minute consultation - CONFIRMED
- [x] 5 script limit - CONFIRMED
- [x] DELETE backend (not archive) - CONFIRMED
- [x] AGGRESSIVE transformation - CONFIRMED

## Notes
- Architectural mismatch confirmed: backend analyzes external repos, not user project
- SSOT structure defined and enforced
- DRY enforcement rules established
- User wants AGGRESSIVE changes, DELETE not archive
- 5 script hard limit to prevent proliferation

## Checkpoints
- Pre-transformation state: CREATED (git tag + backup)
- Phase 1 ready: YES
- User approval: RECEIVED
