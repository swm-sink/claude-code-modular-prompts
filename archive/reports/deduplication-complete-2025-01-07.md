# Deduplication Complete Report
Date: 2025-07-07
Agent: Agent 4 - Deduplication Specialist
Issue: #107

## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved concept duplications across the framework by establishing canonical sources and updating all references.

## Canonical Sources Established

### 1. TDD Concepts
- **Canonical Source**: `quality/tdd.md`
- **Concepts**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle, coverage requirements (90% line, 85% branch)
- **Updated Modules**: 7 modules now reference this canonical source

### 2. PRD Concepts
- **Canonical Source**: `planning/prd-core.md` (newly created)
- **Concepts**: PRD template, requirement quality standards, user story formats
- **Updated Modules**: 2 modules now reference this canonical source

### 3. Session Management
- **Canonical Source**: `patterns/session-management.md`
- **Status**: Already well-centralized, no changes needed

### 4. Critical Thinking
- **Canonical Source**: `quality/critical-thinking.md`
- **Status**: Already well-centralized, no changes needed

## Changes Made

### New Files Created
1. `planning/prd-core.md` - Canonical source for PRD concepts
2. `scripts/check-duplications.py` - Validation script for ongoing monitoring
3. `docs/reports/deduplication-analysis-2025-07-07.md` - Initial analysis

### Modules Updated
1. `planning/prd-generation.md` - References prd-core.md
2. `planning/intelligent-prd.md` - References prd-core.md
3. `testing/iterative-testing.md` - References quality/tdd.md
4. `testing/auto-testing.md` - References quality/tdd.md
5. `patterns/pattern-library.md` - References quality/tdd.md
6. `quality/production-standards.md` - References quality/tdd.md
7. `quality/feature-validation.md` - References quality/tdd.md
8. `planning/feature-workflow.md` - References quality/tdd.md
9. `development/task-management.md` - References quality/tdd.md

## Validation Results

- **Before**: 17+ concept duplications identified
- **After**: 0 harmful duplications (remaining appearances are legitimate references)
- **Dependencies**: All verified working correctly
- **Consistency**: Framework now has single source of truth for each concept

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All modules use same standards and definitions
2. **Maintainability**: Updates only needed in canonical sources
3. **Clarity**: Clear references show where concepts are defined
4. **Quality**: Reduced risk of conflicting requirements

## Recommendations

1. Use `scripts/check-duplications.py` regularly to prevent future duplications
2. Always reference canonical sources when implementing concepts
3. Update canonical sources when requirements change
4. Document any new canonical sources in this pattern

## Success Metrics

✅ All concept duplications resolved
✅ Canonical sources established
✅ All references updated
✅ No broken dependencies
✅ Validation script created for ongoing monitoring
