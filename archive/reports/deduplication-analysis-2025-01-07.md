# Deduplication Analysis Report

Agent: Agent 4 - Deduplication Specialist
Issue: #107

## Executive Summary

Analysis of the framework reveals significant concept duplications across modules that need to be resolved to maintain a single source of truth.

## Major Duplications Identified

### 1. TDD/Testing Concepts

**Current State:**
- `quality/tdd.md` - Primary TDD module with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR enforcement
- `testing/iterative-testing.md` - Contains duplicate TDD cycle implementation (lines 23-162)
- `testing/auto-testing.md` - References TDD but doesn't duplicate core concepts

**Analysis:**
- Significant overlap between tdd.md and iterative-testing.md
- Both define RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles with slight variations
- Testing strategy duplicated across modules

**Recommendation:**
- **Canonical Source**: `quality/tdd.md` (most comprehensive)
- Update `testing/iterative-testing.md` to reference tdd.md for core TDD concepts
- Focus iterative-testing.md on its unique value: continuous integration and stakeholder feedback

### 2. PRD/Planning Concepts

**Current State:**
- `planning/prd-generation.md` - Traditional PRD generation workflow
- `planning/intelligent-prd.md` - Autonomous requirement extraction
- Both contain overlapping requirement discovery and PRD template sections

**Analysis:**
- Different approaches (manual vs autonomous) but duplicate core PRD concepts
- PRD template structure duplicated
- Requirement quality gates overlap

**Recommendation:**
- **Canonical Source**: Create new `planning/prd-core.md` for shared concepts
- `prd-generation.md` focuses on manual/guided workflow
- `intelligent-prd.md` focuses on autonomous extraction

### 3. Session Management/GitHub Issues

**Current State:**
- Session management concepts scattered across multiple modules
- Many modules reference GitHub issue creation without central guidance
- No single source for session tracking standards

**Analysis:**
- `patterns/session-management.md` exists but isn't referenced consistently
- Multiple modules implement their own session integration

**Recommendation:**
- **Canonical Source**: `patterns/session-management.md`
- All modules should reference this for session-related functionality

### 4. Critical Thinking

**Current State:**
- `quality/critical-thinking.md` - Comprehensive critical thinking enforcement
- Referenced by many modules but some implement their own analysis phases

**Analysis:**
- Good centralization already exists
- Some modules duplicate analysis requirements

**Recommendation:**
- **Canonical Source**: `quality/critical-thinking.md` (already well-positioned)
- Ensure all modules reference rather than redefine

### 5. Testing Strategy/Coverage Requirements

**Current State:**
- Coverage requirements defined in multiple places:
  - `quality/tdd.md` - 90% line, 85% branch
  - `testing/iterative-testing.md` - Duplicates same requirements
  - `testing/auto-testing.md` - Different metrics (95% coverage)

**Analysis:**
- Inconsistent coverage requirements across modules
- Testing organization duplicated

**Recommendation:**
- **Canonical Source**: Define in `quality/tdd.md`
- Other modules reference these standards

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Canonical Sources
1. Create `planning/prd-core.md` for shared PRD concepts
2. Ensure `quality/tdd.md` contains all core TDD concepts
3. Verify `patterns/session-management.md` is comprehensive

### Phase 2: Update Referencing Modules
1. Update all modules to reference canonical sources
2. Remove duplicate definitions
3. Focus each module on its unique value proposition

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Verify no broken dependencies
2. Ensure all concepts have single source of truth
3. Run validation to confirm deduplication success

## Metrics
- Current duplicate concepts: 17+ identified
- Target: 0 duplicate concepts
- Affected modules: 15+
