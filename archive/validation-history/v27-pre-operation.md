# Agent V27: Pre-Operation Report - Settings Protection Auditor
Date: 2025-07-13
Mission: Audit settings protection to ensure wildcard syntax regression prevention is enforced

## Mission Context
Agent V27 has been tasked with auditing the settings protection mechanisms to prevent regression to broken wildcard syntax patterns in Claude Code settings. This is critical for maintaining Claude Code's autonomy and preventing permission prompt loops.

## Key Focus Areas
1. **Settings File Protection**: Verify .claude/settings.local.json is protected from modifications
2. **Wildcard Pattern Detection**: Search for and eliminate any wildcard patterns
3. **Individual Command Validation**: Ensure all Bash permissions use individual commands
4. **CLAUDE.md Enforcement**: Confirm protection rules are clear and enforceable
5. **Codebase-wide Search**: Find any wildcard pattern usage across the entire repository
6. **Detection Script**: Create automated wildcard detection capability
7. **Documentation**: Report findings and enforcement mechanisms

## Critical Patterns to Prevent
The following patterns are KNOWN BROKEN in Claude Code:
- `"Bash(git:*)"` - Broken, causes permission loops
- `"Bash(ls:*)"` - Broken, intermittent failures  
- `"Bash(*)"` - Broken, documented GitHub issues
- `"Bash(*:*)"` - Broken, memory management issues

## Working Pattern Format
- `"Bash(git)"` - Individual command permissions ONLY
- `"Bash(git add)"` - Specific command variants allowed
- `"Bash(ls)"` - No wildcards or colons
- `"Bash(python)"` - Simple command names

## Evidence Base
Multiple GitHub issues document the wildcard bug:
- Issue #462: "Allowing `Bash(*)` or `Bash(*:*)` doesn't seem to work"
- Issue #2560: "Claude code keeps asking for permission despite already having it"
- Issue #2733: "Infinite bash permission loop"
- Issue #74: "Claude does not understand that it does have the correct bash permissions"

## Operation Plan
1. Verify settings file existence and protection status
2. Search for wildcard patterns in all settings files
3. Validate Bash permissions format compliance
4. Review CLAUDE.md protection rules effectiveness
5. Perform comprehensive codebase search for wildcards
6. Create automated detection script
7. Document all findings and recommendations

## Success Criteria
- Zero wildcard patterns found in settings files
- All Bash permissions use individual command format
- CLAUDE.md protection rules are comprehensive and clear
- Detection script successfully identifies all wildcard patterns
- Complete documentation of findings and enforcement

## Risks
- Settings modifications could break Claude Code autonomy
- Wildcard patterns could cause infinite permission loops
- Regression to broken syntax would impact productivity
