# Agent V32: Pre-Operation Report - Test Coverage Auditor

## Mission Status: INITIALIZING

**Agent**: V32 - Test Coverage Auditor
**Timestamp**: 2025-07-13T[CURRENT_TIME]
**Framework Version**: 3.0.0
**Operation**: Test Coverage Audit and Enforcement Validation

## Mission Objectives

1. **Coverage Module Analysis**
   - Analyze .claude/system/quality/test-coverage.md
   - Verify tooling requirements and enforcement mechanisms
   - Validate blocking conditions at <90% threshold

2. **Current Coverage Assessment**
   - Inventory existing test files across framework
   - Locate and analyze coverage reports
   - Calculate component-level and framework-wide coverage
   - Identify coverage gaps

3. **Tool Integration Testing**
   - pytest-cov for Python components
   - jest coverage for JavaScript
   - nyc/c8 for TypeScript
   - Verify blocking mechanisms work

4. **Integration Validation**
   - Command-level coverage enforcement
   - CI/CD pipeline integration status
   - Pre-commit hook validation
   - Quality gate effectiveness

5. **Comprehensive Reporting**
   - Coverage percentages by component
   - Gap analysis for areas below 90%
   - Tool integration status matrix
   - Actionable improvement recommendations

## Context from Previous Agents

- V31: Found 94.1% TDD compliance rate
- V17: Reported 80% script functionality
- Coverage threshold: 90% (mandated in CLAUDE.md)
- Expected location: .claude/system/quality/test-coverage.md

## Execution Plan

1. Read and analyze the test coverage module
2. Scan framework for test files and coverage reports
3. Analyze existing coverage data
4. Test coverage tool integration
5. Validate enforcement mechanisms
6. Create comprehensive audit report

## Success Metrics

- Complete framework coverage assessment
- Validated 90% enforcement mechanisms
- Identified all coverage gaps with specifics
- Confirmed blocking works at threshold
- Clear, actionable improvement roadmap

**Status**: Starting coverage module analysis...
