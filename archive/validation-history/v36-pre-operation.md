# Agent V36: Command Chain Tester - Pre-Operation Report

| Agent | Phase | Mission | Status |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| V36 | Post-Swarm | Command Chain Testing | Starting |

## Mission Context
Following the successful completion of V31-V35 quality enforcement testing, I'm now tasked with validating the advanced command chaining architecture of the framework.

## Analysis Plan

### 1. Command Chaining Architecture Review
- Read and analyze command-chaining-architecture.md
- Review /chain command implementation in CLAUDE.md
- Identify all workflow patterns (sequential, parallel, conditional, iterative)
- Map state management mechanisms

### 2. Workflow Pattern Testing
**Sequential Testing**:
- /query → /feature → /task workflow
- State passing validation
- Error propagation testing

**Parallel Testing**:
- /swarm coordination with multiple tasks
- Concurrent execution validation
- Result consolidation

**Conditional Testing**:
- /auto with dynamic routing
- Decision tree validation
- Branch execution testing

**Iterative Testing**:
- Convergence criteria validation
- Loop termination testing
- State accumulation

### 3. State Management Validation
- Context preservation between commands
- Result accumulation and transfer
- Error state handling
- Atomic rollback capability

### 4. Error Recovery Testing
- Command failure scenarios
- Partial success handling
- Rollback trigger validation
- Alternative routing mechanisms

### 5. Performance Impact Analysis
- Chain execution overhead
- State management costs
- Optimization opportunities
- Scalability assessment

## Success Metrics
- All workflow patterns functional
- State management reliable
- Error recovery effective
- Performance acceptable
- Integration path clear

## Expected Deliverables
1. Comprehensive command chain test report
2. State management validation results
3. Error recovery test outcomes
4. Performance impact analysis
5. Integration recommendations
