| 7 | Partial | V31-V35 | 80% |

## Agent Results

### V31: TDD Compliance Validator ✅
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **TDD Compliance**: 94.1%
- **Findings**: Excellent TDD enforcement across all development commands
- **Key Achievement**: Multi-layer blocking prevents bypasses

### V32: Test Coverage Auditor ✅
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Coverage**: 82% (FAILING 90% requirement)
- **Critical Finding**: No automated enforcement despite documentation
- **Risk**: Claims enforcement but has none

### V33: Security Standards Validator ✅
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Security Score**: 87/100
- **Findings**: Enterprise-grade security, zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Achievement**: Comprehensive threat modeling integrated

### V34: Performance Benchmark Tester ✅
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Performance**: 7.53ms p95 (96% better than 200ms requirement)
- **Grade**: A+ (9.8/10)
- **Achievement**: Exceptional performance with significant headroom

### V35: Quality Gate Integration Tester ⚠️
- **Status**: TIMEOUT - Incomplete
- **Progress**: Pre-execution report created, main execution timed out
- **Impact**: Quality gate validation incomplete

## Phase 7 Key Findings

1. **TDD Excellence**: 94.1% compliance with robust enforcement
2. **Coverage Gap**: Only 82% coverage with NO enforcement (critical issue)
3. **Security Strong**: 87/100 score with enterprise-grade implementation
4. **Performance Outstanding**: 96% better than requirements
5. **Quality Gates**: Testing incomplete due to timeout

## Critical Actions Required

1. **Fix Coverage Enforcement**: Implement the missing 90% coverage blocking
2. **Complete V35**: Quality gate testing needs completion
3. **Address Timeout Issues**: Consider breaking down complex agents

## Overall Phase 7 Status
- 4/5 agents completed successfully
- Critical gaps identified in coverage enforcement
- Framework shows strong quality foundations but needs enforcement hardening
