# PRE-EXECUTION REPORT: Agent V16 - Script Inventory Builder

**Date**: 2025-07-13
**Agent**: V16
**Mission**: Catalog all Python scripts in the framework and create a comprehensive inventory

## Objectives

1. Find all Python scripts (.py files) in the entire repository
2. Categorize scripts by purpose (validation, analysis, utility, etc.)
3. Document script locations and basic functionality
4. Identify script creation dates and last modifications
5. Check for script documentation (docstrings, comments)
6. Create a script inventory with metadata

## Planned Approach

1. **Discovery Phase**:
   - Search for all .py files using Glob
   - Search for all .sh files (shell scripts)
   - Identify script locations across the repository

2. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Read each script to understand its purpose
   - Extract docstrings and comments
   - Categorize by functionality
   - Check file metadata for timestamps

3. **Documentation Phase**:
   - Create comprehensive inventory report
   - Include script metadata and functionality
   - Organize by category and location
   - Document any missing documentation

## Expected Outcomes

- Complete inventory of all Python and shell scripts
- Categorized script listing with descriptions
- Metadata including locations and timestamps
- Documentation status for each script
- Recommendations for script organization

## Pre-Execution State

Starting fresh inventory build with no prior script catalog available.
