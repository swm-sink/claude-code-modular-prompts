# Agent V35 Pre-Operation Report

**Date**: 2025-07-13
**Agent**: V35 - Quality Gate Integration Tester
**Framework Version**: 3.0.0

## Mission Overview
Testing quality gate functionality and enforcement across all integration points to validate that quality gates are properly blocking non-compliant code and working consistently throughout the framework.

## Pre-Operation Status
- **Previous Agent Reports**:
  - V31: 94.1% TDD compliance detected
  - V32: 82% test coverage, no enforcement mechanisms found
  - V33: 87/100 security score
  - V34: 7.53ms p95 performance (well within 200ms limit)

## Planned Operations
1. **Quality Gate System Analysis**
   - Read universal-quality-gates.md module
   - Review gate categories and enforcement levels
   - Check integration architecture
   - Validate blocking mechanisms

2. **Gate Functionality Testing**
   - TDD gate: RED→GREEN→REFACTOR blocking validation
   - Coverage gate: <90% threshold blocking
   - Security gate: Vulnerability detection blocking
   - Performance gate: >200ms response blocking
   - Documentation gate: Missing docs blocking

3. **Integration Point Testing**
   - Command-level gate integration
   - Module-level enforcement
   - Runtime orchestration gates
   - CI/CD pipeline integration

4. **Blocking Mechanism Validation**
   - BLOCKING level enforcement
   - CONDITIONAL level logic
   - WARNING level behavior
   - Rollback trigger validation

5. **Comprehensive Reporting**
   - Gate effectiveness percentage
   - Integration coverage analysis
   - Blocking mechanism reliability
   - Gap analysis and recommendations

## Expected Outcomes
- Complete validation of all quality gates
- Identification of any bypass vulnerabilities
- Clear understanding of integration coverage
- Actionable recommendations for hardening

## Risk Assessment
- May discover gaps in enforcement
- Could find inconsistent integration
- Possible missing blocking mechanisms
- Potential bypass routes
