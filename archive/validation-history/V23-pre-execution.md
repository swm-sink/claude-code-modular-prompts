# Agent V23: DRY Documentation Enforcer - Pre-Execution Report

## Mission
Enforce DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles across all documentation to create single sources of truth.

## Context from Previous Agents
- V21: Fixed many broken references
- V22: Found version consistency issues
- Previous agents created new documentation, potentially introducing duplication

## Planned Tasks
1. Identify duplicate documentation content
2. Find information repeated in multiple files
3. Create canonical source locations
4. Replace duplicates with references to canonical sources
5. Consolidate similar documentation
6. Create DRY validation script

## Focus Areas
- Command documentation duplicated in multiple places
- Framework principles repeated
- Installation instructions
- Configuration documentation
- Module descriptions

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear identification of all duplicate content
- Establishment of canonical source locations
- Replacement of duplicates with references
- DRY validation script for future use
- Comprehensive report on DRY enforcement
