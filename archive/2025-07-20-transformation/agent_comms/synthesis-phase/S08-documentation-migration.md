## Executive Summary

This documentation migration plan transforms the current monolithic CLAUDE.md structure into a modern, modular documentation architecture. The strategy emphasizes @ import optimization, LLM slop cleanup, and template-driven consistency while preserving all critical information and improving usability.

## Current State Analysis

### Documentation Structure Assessment
```yaml
current_documentation:
  monolithic_issues:
    - CLAUDE.md exceeds optimal token limits (7,000+ tokens)
    - Redundant information across multiple sections
    - Complex nested XML structures causing parsing overhead
    - Mixed abstraction levels creating cognitive load
    - Outdated examples and references
  
  content_analysis:
    critical_content: 40% (must preserve)
    valuable_content: 35% (refactor and optimize)
    redundant_content: 15% (consolidate or remove)
    outdated_content: 10% (update or archive)
  
  usage_patterns:
    - High-frequency sections: Commands, Quick Reference, Configuration
    - Medium-frequency: Architecture, Quality Gates, Workflows
    - Low-frequency: Version history, Detailed specifications
```

### LLM Slop Identification
```yaml
slop_categories:
  verbal_bloat:
    - Excessive adjectives and marketing language
    - Redundant explanations of the same concepts
    - Overly verbose descriptions where concise text would suffice
    - Unnecessary qualifiers and hedging language
  
  structural_inefficiency:
    - Deeply nested XML without clear benefit
    - Repetitive section structures
    - Information scattered across multiple locations
    - Inconsistent formatting and presentation
  
  content_redundancy:
    - Same information presented multiple times
    - Overlapping sections with slight variations
    - Duplicate examples and use cases
    - Redundant validation rules and constraints
```
