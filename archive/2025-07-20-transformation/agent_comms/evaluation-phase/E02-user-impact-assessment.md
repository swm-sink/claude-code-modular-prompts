```

## Final User Impact Assessment

**RECOMMENDATION: CONDITIONAL GO WITH ENHANCED UX SAFEGUARDS**

The migration will deliver significant long-term user value but requires careful management of the transition period. Key requirements:

1. **Extended Onboarding**: 4-6 week guided transition period
2. **Enhanced Support**: Dedicated migration assistance and documentation
3. **Gradual Feature Introduction**: Progressive capability revelation
4. **Comprehensive Safety Net**: Rollback capability and legacy access
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time UX tracking and rapid issue resolution

**User Success Probability: 75-85%** (with proper safeguards and support)
**Risk Level: MEDIUM** (manageable with enhanced communication and support)

The transformation is user-positive but requires significant investment in change management and user support to achieve success.
