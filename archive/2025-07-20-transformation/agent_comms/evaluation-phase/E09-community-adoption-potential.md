## Executive Summary

**GO/NO-GO RECOMMENDATION: GO WITH COMMUNITY STRATEGY ENHANCEMENTS**

The framework transformation has strong potential for community adoption but lacks comprehensive community engagement strategy. While the modular architecture enables community contributions, documentation complexity and learning curve may limit adoption. Enhanced community strategy and gradual rollout recommended.
