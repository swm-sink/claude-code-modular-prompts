# Context-Prime Module Analysis

**Date**: 2025-07-19  
**Task**: Analyze current context-prime capabilities for enhancement  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  

## 📊 Current Context-Prime Capabilities

### Core Functions
1. **Project Structure Recognition**
   - Directory analysis and architecture inference
   - Framework identification and build system analysis
   - File importance scoring and dependency mapping

2. **Development Context Analysis**
   - Git history analysis (commits, branches, merges)
   - Active work detection (uncommitted changes, stashes)
   - Decision context reconstruction from commits/comments

3. **Workflow Pattern Recognition**
   - Development methodology detection (TDD, CI/CD)
   - Coding conventions and naming patterns
   - Tooling integration analysis

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel execution with <3s loading targets
   - Memory management for 200k token context
   - Intelligent caching strategies

5. **Security Controls**
   - Operation timeouts and emergency controls
   - Safe execution with input sanitization
   - Risk assessment and audit logging

## ❌ Missing Capabilities

### No Document Generation
- **Issue**: Context-prime only "primes" context but doesn't create written findings
- **Need**: Both commands should generate analysis documents
- **Solution**: Add document generation phase to both modules

### No Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Issue**: Single-agent analysis only
- **Need**: Context-prime-mega should coordinate multiple agents
- **Solution**: Design sequential agent workflow with findings compilation

### No Codebase Size Assessment
- **Issue**: Doesn't assess codebase complexity to determine analysis scope
- **Need**: Auto-detect or ask user about codebase size
- **Solution**: Add codebase sizing logic for agent allocation

## 🎯 Enhancement Requirements

### For Context-Prime (existing)
1. Add document generation phase after context loading
2. Create structured findings report with:
   - Project overview and architecture
   - Issues and technical debt
   - Development patterns and conventions
   - Recommendations for improvement

### For Context-Prime-Mega (new)
1. Codebase size detection/assessment
2. Agent allocation based on complexity
3. Sequential agent coordination
4. Comprehensive findings compilation
5. Critical analysis and recommendations

## 📋 Implementation Strategy

1. **Enhance existing context-prime** with document generation
2. **Create context-prime-mega** with multi-agent capabilities
3. **Add both commands** to CLAUDE.md architecture
4. **Test document generation** functionality
5. **Validate agent coordination** works properly
