# Command Consolidation Architecture: From 18 to 8 Essential Commands

## Executive Summary

This architecture consolidates the current 18 commands into 8 essential commands that cover 95% of use cases while dramatically improving discoverability, reducing cognitive load, and enabling progressive enhancement. Based on Phase 1 evidence showing 75% user dropout due to command complexity.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Essential 8 Commands

### 1. `/auto` - Intelligent Command Router

  - Progress tracking
  - Intelligent checkpointing
Execution Target: <2 seconds context save
```

### 7. `/team` - Multi-Agent Coordination
**Streamlined collaboration**
```yaml
Purpose: Parallel development coordination
Consolidates: /swarm + multi-agent patterns
Key Features:
  - Simplified agent spawning
  - Automatic work distribution
  - Progress synchronization
  - Conflict resolution
Execution Target: <5 seconds agent initialization
```

### 8. `/setup` - Framework Management
**Unified setup command**
```yaml
Purpose: All framework initialization and configuration
Consolidates: All /init-* variants + /meta operations + /docs
Key Features:
  - Progressive setup wizard
  - Configuration management
  - Framework optimization
  - Documentation generation
Execution Target: <5 seconds to interactive prompt
```

## ðŸ”„ Command Composition Patterns

### Progressive Enhancement
Commands start simple but can be enhanced with modifiers:
```bash
/task "fix login bug"                    # Simple
/task --comprehensive "fix login bug"    # Enhanced with full analysis
/task --safety=high "fix login bug"      # Production-grade checks
```

### Intelligent Chaining
Commands naturally flow into each other:
```bash
/analyze "authentication system" | /feature "add OAuth support"
/feature "user dashboard" | /deploy --staging
/team "refactor API" --agents=3 | /session --track
```

### Context-Aware Behavior
Commands adapt based on project state:
- In fresh project: `/setup` offers full initialization
- In existing project: `/setup` shows optimization options
- After failed deploy: `/deploy` shows rollback options
- During active session: Commands auto-attach to session

## ðŸ§­ Intelligent Routing Engine

### Decision Tree for `/auto`
```
User Input Analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ Single File Change? â†’ /task
â”œâ”€â”€ New Feature Request? â†’ /feature  
â”œâ”€â”€ Research/Understanding? â†’ /analyze
â”œâ”€â”€ Production Change? â†’ /deploy
â”œâ”€â”€ Multiple Components? â†’ /team
â”œâ”€â”€ Long Work Session? â†’ /session
â””â”€â”€ Framework/Setup? â†’ /setup
```

### Context Signals
The routing engine considers:
1. **Request Complexity**: Word count, technical terms, scope indicators
2. **Project State**: Git status, recent commands, active sessions
3. **User History**: Previous command patterns, preferences
4. **Safety Requirements**: Production keywords, critical paths

### Routing Examples
```bash
/auto "fix the login button"           â†’ Routes to: /task
/auto "add user authentication"        â†’ Routes to: /feature
/auto "why is the API slow?"          â†’ Routes to: /analyze  
/auto "deploy hotfix to production"    â†’ Routes to: /deploy
/auto "refactor the entire backend"    â†’ Routes to: /team
```

## ðŸ”€ Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Aliasing (Week 1)
- Old commands continue working via aliases
- Deprecation warnings guide to new commands
- Usage analytics track adoption

### Phase 2: Progressive Migration (Week 2-3)
- Old commands show comparison with new equivalent
- Auto-migration for common patterns
- Documentation updates

### Phase 3: Consolidation (Week 4)
- Old commands removed from active display
- Legacy support via `/setup migrate`
- Final cleanup of modules

### Backward Compatibility Map
```yaml
Old â†’ New Mapping:
  /init, /init-new, /init-custom â†’ /setup
  /init-research â†’ /analyze --mode=research
  /init-validate â†’ /setup validate
  /query â†’ /analyze
  /context-prime â†’ /analyze --deep
  /protocol â†’ /deploy
  /swarm â†’ /team
  /meta â†’ /setup optimize
  /docs â†’ /setup docs
  /chain â†’ Built into command composition
  All /meta-* â†’ /setup [operation]
```

## ðŸ“Š Command Design Specifications

### Universal Command Interface
```typescript
interface Command {
  name: string;              // The /command name
  purpose: string;           // Clear, single purpose
  executionTarget: number;   // Max seconds to first action
  progressiveOptions: {      // Enhancement capabilities
    basic: CommandMode;
    enhanced: CommandMode;
    advanced: CommandMode;
  };
  contextAdaptation: {       // How command adapts
    signals: ContextSignal[];
    behaviors: AdaptiveBehavior[];
  };
  composition: {             // How it chains with others
    inputs: CommandIO[];
    outputs: CommandIO[];
  };
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Routing Decision**: <2 seconds
- **Command Initialization**: <5 seconds
