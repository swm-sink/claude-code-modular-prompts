# Experimental Features Archive

**Archive Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Purpose:** Experimental features and approaches that were explored but not integrated into production framework

## Contents

### claude-framework-experiment/
**Original Location:** /archive-claude-framework/  
**Description:** JSON-based prompt system experiment  
**Status:** Explored alternative to markdown-based module system

This experiment explored using JSON files for prompt management instead of the current markdown-based system. While interesting, it was deemed overly complex compared to the simpler markdown approach.

Key learnings:
- JSON adds unnecessary complexity for prompt management
- Markdown is more readable and maintainable
- Version control works better with markdown files
- The modular markdown approach is superior for this use case

### metrics-archive/
**Original Location:** /metrics-archive/  
**Description:** Historical metrics data  
**Status:** Superseded by GitHub issue tracking

Contains historical metrics from early framework development. Modern metrics are tracked through GitHub issues and the framework's built-in validation systems.

## Recovery Instructions

These experimental features are preserved for reference but should generally not be recovered. If concepts from these experiments are needed:

1. Extract only the specific useful patterns
2. Reimplement using current framework standards
3. Ensure compatibility with markdown-based module system
4. Follow current architectural principles

## Lessons Learned

1. **Simplicity Wins:** Markdown modules are more maintainable than JSON
2. **Native Tools:** GitHub issues provide better metrics than custom solutions
3. **Framework Focus:** Staying focused on core functionality prevents over-engineering
4. **Experimentation Value:** Failed experiments still provide valuable insights
