# Orphaned Modules Archive

**Archive Date:** 2025-07-07  
**Reason:** Framework stabilization and cleanup  
**Related Issue:** #87 (Phase 1: Critical DRY Violations)

## Summary
These 15 modules were archived because they are not referenced by any command and are not part of the active framework functionality.

## Archived Modules

### Patterns Category (13 modules)
- `anti-patterns.md` - Anti-pattern documentation
- `pattern-combination.md` - Pattern combination logic  
- `pattern-matching.md` - Pattern matching system
- `pattern-templates.md` - Pattern template definitions
- `pattern-versioning.md` - Pattern version management
- `prompt-patterns.md` - Prompt pattern library
- `search-functionality.md` - Search functionality patterns
- `usage-examples.md` - Usage example documentation
- `validation-rules.md` - Validation rule definitions
- `evaluation-testing.md` - Evaluation testing framework
- `effectiveness-metrics.md` - Effectiveness measurement system
- `recommendation-engine.md` - Pattern recommendation engine
- `contribution-guidelines.md` - Contribution guidelines

### Quality Category (1 module)
- `honesty-policy.md` - Honesty policy documentation

### Testing Category (1 module)  
- `test-management.md` - Test management system

## Rationale
These modules were created during earlier framework development phases but are no longer actively used:

1. **No Command References:** None of these modules are referenced by any command in `.claude/commands/`
2. **Test Warnings:** They were generating orphaned module warnings in test suite
3. **Functional Redundancy:** Core functionality is covered by active modules
4. **Framework Clarity:** Removing them improves framework focus and clarity

## Recovery
If any of these modules are needed in the future:
1. Review the archived content for relevant patterns
2. Extract useful functionality into active modules
3. Update command references as needed
4. Follow proper module integration patterns

## Related Actions
- Updated test suite expectations to reflect reduced module count
- Verified no broken references remain in active codebase
- Updated framework documentation to reflect actual module inventory
