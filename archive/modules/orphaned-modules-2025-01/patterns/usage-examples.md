## Chain-of-Thought Examples

### Example 1: Debug Complex API Integration

**Scenario**: User needs to debug a failing API integration with multiple potential causes

**Input**: "My API integration is failing. The authentication works, but I'm getting inconsistent 500 errors on POST requests. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't."

**Applied Pattern**: Chain-of-Thought

**Prompt Structure**:
```xml
<task>
Debug API integration with intermittent 500 errors on POST requests
</task>

<reasoning_approach>
Let's work through this systematically:

1. Identify the scope of the problem
2. Analyze the error pattern and consistency
3. Examine potential causes in order of likelihood
4. Develop a testing strategy
5. Propose specific debugging steps
</reasoning_approach>

<instructions>
Please show your reasoning for each step and explain how you arrive at each conclusion.
</instructions>
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Let me analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Problem Scope Analysis**
   - Authentication is working (rules out auth issues)
   - Only POST requests affected (GET requests likely working)
   - Intermittent nature suggests load/timing/state issues

2. **Error Pattern Analysis**
   - 500 errors indicate server-side issues
   - Inconsistency suggests race conditions, resource limits, or state problems
   - Need to identify: frequency, timing patterns, data patterns

3. **Potential Causes (by likelihood)**
   - Request payload size/format inconsistencies
   - Database connection pool exhaustion
   - Race conditions in server-side processing
   - Memory leaks causing intermittent failures
   - Load balancer configuration issues

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Implement request logging with full payload capture
   - Add server resource monitoring during failures
   - Test with consistent vs. varying payload sizes
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

5. **Specific Debugging Steps**
   - Add comprehensive logging to capture request/response details
   - Monitor server metrics (CPU, memory, DB connections)
   - Test with smaller payloads to isolate size-related issues
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern for resilience
```

**Benefits Demonstrated**:
- Systematic problem breakdown
- Logical progression from general to specific
- Clear action items generated
- Transparent reasoning process

### Example 2: Algorithm Optimization

**Scenario**: Optimize a sorting algorithm for specific constraints

**Input**: "I need to optimize a sorting algorithm for an array of 10,000 custom objects. Each object has a priority score (float) and a timestamp. I need to sort by priority first, then by timestamp for ties. Memory is limited."

**Applied Pattern**: Chain-of-Thought with optimization focus

**Prompt Structure**:
```xml
<task>
Optimize sorting algorithm for 10K custom objects with priority and timestamp
</task>

<constraints>
- Memory limited environment
- Objects have priority (float) and timestamp
- Sort by priority first, timestamp second for ties
</constraints>

<reasoning_approach>
Let's optimize this step-by-step:

1. Analyze the sorting requirements and constraints
2. Evaluate algorithm options for this specific case
3. Consider memory optimization strategies
4. Design the optimal solution
5. Verify performance characteristics
</reasoning_approach>
```

## Tree-of-Thought Examples

### Example 3: Architecture Decision

**Scenario**: Choose architecture for a new microservices system

**Input**: "I'm designing a new e-commerce platform. Should I use microservices, monolith, or modular monolith? We have a team of 8 developers, expect moderate traffic initially with growth potential, and need to launch in 6 months."

**Applied Pattern**: Tree-of-Thought

**Prompt Structure**:
```xml
<problem>
Choose architecture for e-commerce platform: microservices vs monolith vs modular monolith
</problem>

<exploration_framework>
Let's explore multiple approaches to this architecture decision:

<approach_a>
  <reasoning>Pure Microservices Architecture</reasoning>
  <implementation>Separate services for users, products, orders, payments, inventory</implementation>
  <pros>High scalability, technology diversity, independent deployment</pros>
  <cons>Complex deployment, network overhead, distributed debugging challenges</cons>
  <feasibility_score>6/10 (complex for team size and timeline)</feasibility_score>
</approach_a>

<approach_b>
  <reasoning>Monolithic Architecture</reasoning>
  <implementation>Single deployable unit with modular internal structure</implementation>
  <pros>Simple deployment, easier debugging, faster initial development</pros>
  <cons>Limited scalability, technology lock-in, harder to maintain as it grows</cons>
  <feasibility_score>8/10 (fits team and timeline well)</feasibility_score>
</approach_b>

<approach_c>
  <reasoning>Modular Monolith</reasoning>
  <implementation>Single deployment with strong module boundaries, prepared for extraction</implementation>
  <pros>Balance of simplicity and future flexibility, easier refactoring to microservices</pros>
  <cons>Requires discipline to maintain boundaries, moderate complexity</cons>
  <feasibility_score>9/10 (optimal for current situation)</feasibility_score>
</approach_c>
</exploration_framework>

<evaluation>
Compare approaches using: development speed, scalability, team capacity, maintenance overhead, future flexibility
</evaluation>
```

## Few-Shot Learning Examples

### Example 4: Code Comment Generation

**Scenario**: Generate consistent documentation comments for API functions

**Input**: "Generate documentation comments for this new API function using our company's standard format"

**Applied Pattern**: Few-Shot Learning

**Prompt Structure**:
```xml
<task_definition>
Generate API documentation comments following company standards
</task_definition>

<examples>
Here are examples of the desired pattern:

Example 1:
Input: 
```python
def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
    return database.fetch_user(user_id)
```

Output:
```python
def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
    """
    Retrieves a user record from the database.
    
    Args:
        user_id (int): Unique identifier for the user
        
    Returns:
        User: User object containing profile information
        
    Raises:
        UserNotFoundError: If user_id doesn't exist
        DatabaseError: If database connection fails
        
    Example:
        >>> user = get_user(123)
        >>> print(user.name)
        'John Doe'
    """
    return database.fetch_user(user_id)
```

Example 2:
Input:
```python
def create_order(user_id: int, items: List[Item]) -> Order:
    return order_service.create(user_id, items)
```

Output:
```python
def create_order(user_id: int, items: List[Item]) -> Order:
    """
    Creates a new order for the specified user.
    
    Args:
        user_id (int): ID of the user placing the order
        items (List[Item]): List of items to include in the order
        
    Returns:
        Order: Created order object with generated order ID
        
    Raises:
        InvalidUserError: If user_id is invalid or inactive
        EmptyOrderError: If items list is empty
        InventoryError: If any items are out of stock
        
    Example:
        >>> items = [Item(id=1, quantity=2), Item(id=5, quantity=1)]
        >>> order = create_order(123, items)
        >>> print(order.total_amount)
        29.99
    """
    return order_service.create(user_id, items)
```
</examples>

<application>
Now apply the same pattern to this new function:

Input: 
```python
def update_inventory(product_id: int, quantity_change: int) -> bool:
    return inventory.adjust_stock(product_id, quantity_change)
```

Output:
</application>
```
