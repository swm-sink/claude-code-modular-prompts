## üö® Critical Blockers to Address Immediately

### 1. README Positioning (Must Fix Today)
Current README still says "reference library" - this is confusing users and reducing adoption.

### 2. No Visual Proof (Major Gap)
Users can't visualize the value without seeing setup.sh in action.

### 3. Discovery Problem (Hidden Value)
Target audience doesn't know this exists or understand its value.

### 4. Validation Gap (Credibility Risk)
Framework hasn't been tested by others - could have major issues.
