## Critical Trade-offs

### Speed vs Safety
```yaml
High_Speed_Risks:
  - File conflicts increase
  - Debugging becomes harder
  - Rollback complexity grows
  - State synchronization issues
  
Safety_First_Costs:
  - Execution time multiplies
  - Human fatigue increases
  - Context switching overhead
  - Opportunity cost of delay
```

### Complexity vs Maintainability
```yaml
Complex_Systems:
  pros:
    - Optimal resource utilization
    - Intelligent adaptation
    - Maximum efficiency
  cons:
    - Hard to debug failures
    - Difficult to predict behavior
    - Higher implementation cost
    - Steeper learning curve
    
Simple_Systems:
  pros:
    - Easy to understand
    - Predictable behavior
    - Simple debugging
    - Quick implementation
  cons:
    - Suboptimal performance
    - Missed optimization opportunities
    - Longer execution time
```

### Parallelism vs Coordination Overhead
```yaml
Parallel_Execution:
  benefits:
    - Faster completion
    - Better resource utilization
    - Scalability potential
  costs:
    - Coordination complexity
    - Conflict resolution needed
    - State synchronization overhead
    - Debugging difficulty
    
Sequential_Execution:
  benefits:
    - Zero coordination needed
    - No conflicts possible
    - Simple state management
    - Easy debugging
  costs:
    - Slow execution
    - Poor resource utilization
    - No scalability
```

## Decision Factors

### When to Choose Each Approach

#### Choose Sequential When:
- Safety is paramount (production systems)
- Debugging capability critical
- Team is inexperienced with parallel systems
- Time is not a constraint
- System is fragile or poorly understood

#### Choose Phase-Parallel When:
- Moderate speed improvement needed
- Tasks naturally group into phases
- Some parallelism experience exists
- Good testing infrastructure available
- Rollback capabilities exist

#### Choose Risk-Based When:
- Speed is important but not critical
- Team has strong orchestration skills
- Good risk assessment capabilities
- Adaptive systems preferred
- Mixed task complexity exists

#### Choose Swarm When:
- Speed is absolutely critical
- Failure tolerance is high
- Strong debugging capabilities exist
- System is well-understood
- Experimental environment acceptable

#### Choose Hybrid Progressive When:
- Balance of speed and safety needed
- Want to build confidence progressively
- Mixed skill levels on team
- Prefer adaptive approach
- Production-ready system required

## Resource Constraint Considerations

### Context Window Limits
```yaml
Large_Files_Impact:
  CLAUDE.md: 69KB
  README.md: 9KB
  claude.local.md: 17KB
  
Mitigation_Strategies:
  - Selective file loading
  - Section-based updates
  - Incremental modifications
  - Context compression techniques
```

### File System Constraints
```yaml
Concurrent_Access_Limits:
  - File locks on same file
  - Directory creation races
  - Git operation serialization
  
Mitigation_Strategies:
  - Directory-based work division
  - Atomic file operations
  - Lock-free algorithms where possible
  - Claim-based coordination
```

### Claude Code Constraints
```yaml
Stateless_Nature:
  - No memory between conversations
  - Must reload context each time
  - State only through files
  
Mitigation_Strategies:
  - Comprehensive state files
  - Atomic state updates
  - Checkpoint frequently
  - Clear handoff protocols
