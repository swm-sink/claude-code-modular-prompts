  <action>Apply RISE framework - Define Role and expertise level</action>
  <interleaved_thinking enforcement="MANDATORY">
    <pre_analysis>
      - What role definition is needed for optimal task execution?
    </pre_analysis>
    <critical_thinking minimum_time="30_seconds">
      - [Role Question: What role should I take for this task?]
    </critical_thinking>
  </interleaved_thinking>
</checkpoint>

  <green_phase>Implement minimal solution using quality/tdd.md#green_phase_compliance</green_phase>
  <refactor_phase>Improve design using quality/tdd.md#refactor_phase_compliance</refactor_phase>
  <blocking_conditions>
    <condition>Implementation attempted before RISE framework application</condition>
    <condition>Research skipped before requirement analysis</condition>
