# Orchestration Directory - Session & State Management

## Purpose: Complete 30-60 Minute Discovery Experience Coordination

This directory houses the orchestration system that coordinates the complete 30-60 minute deep discovery experience, managing session state, phase transitions, and quality assurance throughout the entire consultation process.

## How This Differs from Speed-Focused Approach

**❌ Speed Approach**: Isolated tools that don't connect into a cohesive experience
**✅ Depth Approach**: Integrated orchestration creating a seamless 30-60 minute journey

### Speed vs Depth Philosophy
- **Speed**: "Here are separate tools you can use" → Fragmented, incomplete experience
- **Depth**: "Here's a complete consultation journey" → Integrated, comprehensive experience

## Phase 7 Integration: Integration & Orchestration

This directory implements **Phase 7** of the 8-phase deep discovery consultation:

### Duration: 3 days

2. **Progress Management**: Real-time tracking across entire consultation
3. **Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints ensure quality at each phase
4. **Session Management**: Complete state management with pause/resume capability
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of issues with automatic recovery
6. **User Experience**: Professional, polished experience throughout
