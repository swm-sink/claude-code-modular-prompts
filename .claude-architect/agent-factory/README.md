# Agent Factory Directory - Specialized Agent Development Platform

## Purpose: Real Agent Development for Project-Specific Domains

This directory houses the agent development platform that creates real specialized agents suited to discovered project patterns, replacing generic command templates with intelligent, project-aware assistants.

## How This Differs from Speed-Focused Approach

**❌ Speed Approach**: Generic command templates that work the same everywhere
**✅ Depth Approach**: Specialized agents developed for your specific project's domain and patterns

### Speed vs Depth Philosophy
- **Speed**: "Here are some generic commands" → One-size-fits-all mediocrity
- **Depth**: "Here are agents that understand YOUR project" → Specialized excellence
