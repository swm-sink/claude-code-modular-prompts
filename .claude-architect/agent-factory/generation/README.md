# Agent Generation System
**Claude Context Architect - Phase 5, Task 5.2**

## Overview

The Agent Generation System transforms the 14 specialized agent types from the specialization matrix into fully functional, project-specific agents through a comprehensive 5-stage pipeline. This system generates REAL working agents, not generic templates.
