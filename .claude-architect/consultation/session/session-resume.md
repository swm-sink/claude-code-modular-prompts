  validation_checks:
    file_integrity: "Verify JSON structure and completeness"
    schema_version: "Check compatibility with current schema"
    timestamp_validity: "Ensure session not corrupted by age"
    required_fields: "Verify all critical fields present"
    
  error_handling:

      this Claude setup?"
      
    preference_confirmation: |
      "Any changes to your preferences for pace, depth, or communication 
      style since we last talked?"
      
  validation_responses:
    full_agreement: "Perfect! Let's continue exactly where we left off."
    minor_updates: "Let me capture those updates and then we'll continue."
    significant_changes: "Let me adjust our understanding and then proceed."

  position_confirmation:
    current_focus: |
      "We were in the middle of {current_stage_name}, specifically 
      exploring {current_substage}. Our next question focuses on 
      {next_question_topic}."
      
    context_bridge: |
      "Based on what you've told me about {relevant_context}, I'd like 
      to understand {next_question_focus} to complete our understanding 
      of {current_area}."
      
  transition_options:
    direct_continuation: |
      "Ready to continue with the next question?"
      
    brief_review: |
      "Would you like a quick review of this stage's focus before continuing?"
      
    modify_approach: |

  partial_stage_completion:
    detection: "Stage marked in-progress but no current question"
    response: "Determine appropriate restart point within stage"
    recovery: "Brief review and position confirmation"
    
  orphaned_progress:
    detection: "Progress indicators inconsistent with actual data"
    response: "Recalculate based on available information"
    recovery: "Present corrected progress and continue"
```
