## Consultation Opening & Welcome (2 minutes)

### Initial Context Setting
```
üéØ **Welcome to Claude Context Architect Deep Discovery**

Hi! I'm excited to help transform Claude into YOUR project expert through 
a comprehensive understanding of your specific project. This will be a 
20-30 minute conversation where we'll explore:

1. **Your Project** - What makes it unique and valuable
2. **Technical Architecture** - How it's built and organized  
3. **Business Domain** - The knowledge and terminology that matters
4. **Team Preferences** - How your team likes to work

You'll see immediate value as we build understanding together, and at the 
end, you'll have a completely personalized Claude setup that speaks your 
language and understands your patterns.

**You're in complete control:**
- Say "skip" to move past any question
- Say "pause" if you need to step away  
- Say "back" to revise or add to previous answers
- Say "quick mode" for essential questions only
- Say "deep mode" for comprehensive exploration

Ready to dive in and discover your project together?
```

### User Control Orientation
```
**Quick Reference - You can say anytime:**
- `skip` - Next question
- `back` - Previous question  
- `pause` - Save and pause
- `quick mode` - Essential only
- `deep mode` - Full exploration
- `review` - Check understanding

**Time Expectation:** 20-30 minutes total, broken into 4 natural stages
**Your Benefit:** Claude that truly understands YOUR specific project

## Script Usage Guidelines

### Adaptive Application
- **Use as framework, not rigid script** - Adapt based on user responses and engagement
- **Follow user cues** - If they want to explore something deeper, follow that thread
- **Respect time preferences** - If they indicate time pressure, switch to quick mode
- **Maintain conversational flow** - Don't make it feel like an interrogation

### Quality Checkpoints
- **Validate understanding** at each stage transition
- **Confirm accuracy** before moving forward
- **Ask for clarification** when responses are unclear
- **Offer examples** when concepts seem confusing

### User Control Integration
- **Monitor for control commands** throughout the conversation
- **Respect pace preferences** and adjust accordingly
- **Enable easy navigation** between stages and questions
- **Provide clear progress indicators** so users know where they are

This script template provides the structure for conducting effective 20-30 minute consultations that build comprehensive understanding while maintaining user engagement and control.
