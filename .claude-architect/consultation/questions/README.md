- **Confidence Scoring** with automatic clarification triggers
- **Information Extraction** with cross-question synthesis
- **Follow-up Generation** based on response content and context
- **Error Recovery** for vague, contradictory, or incomplete responses

### 5. Adaptation Rules (`adaptation-rules.yaml`)
**Dynamic Consultation Adjustment**
- **Time-Based Adaptation** from ahead-of-schedule to critical pressure
- **Expertise Calibration** for beginner, intermediate, and expert users
- **Engagement Management** with recovery strategies for low engagement
- **Project Complexity** matching from simple to enterprise-scale

- **Confidence Assessment**: Score response quality and trigger clarification when needed  
- **Follow-up Generation**: Create relevant follow-ups based on specific response content
- **Context Building**: Synthesize information across all responses for complete understanding

### Smart Defaults System
- **Automatic Detection**: Recognize project patterns from repository analysis
- **Assumption Management**: Pre-fill obvious information while confirming important details
- **Time Efficiency**: Reduce consultation time by 15-25% through intelligent inference
- **Engagement Enhancement**: Focus on unique project aspects rather than obvious patterns

## Usage Flow

### 1. Question Selection Process
```yaml
Context Analysis → Priority Calculation → Adaptive Selection → Quality Validation
```

### 2. Response Processing Flow
```yaml
Pattern Recognition → Confidence Scoring → Information Extraction → Follow-up Generation
```

### 3. Real-Time Adaptation
```yaml
Continuous Monitoring → Dynamic Adjustment → Quality Maintenance → User Experience Optimization
```

## Quality Assurance Features

### Understanding Validation
- **Stage Transition Checks**: Confirm understanding before advancing
- **Contradiction Detection**: Flag inconsistent information for clarification
- **Completeness Monitoring**: Ensure essential information is captured
- **Confidence Tracking**: Validate extraction quality throughout process

### Engagement Maintenance  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track user engagement and adjust accordingly
- **Recovery Strategies**: Handle confusion, time pressure, and disengagement
- **Value Demonstration**: Show progress and immediate benefits
- **User Control**: Enable navigation, pacing, and depth control

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Recovery**: Handle vague, contradictory, or incomplete responses
- **Clarification Loops**: Systematic approach to resolving confusion
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Switch approaches when current method isn't working
- **Fallback Options**: Maintain progress even when challenges arise

## Integration Points

### With Consultation Flow
- **Stage Management**: Coordinate with 4-stage consultation architecture
- **Time Control**: Integrate with session management and pause/resume
- **Context Building**: Feed into context generation and agent specialization
- **User Experience**: Maintain flow control and user satisfaction

### With Other Systems
- **Repository Analysis**: Use detected patterns for smart defaults
- **Context Generation**: Provide structured information for context creation
- **Agent Factory**: Inform agent specialization requirements
- **Command Generation**: Guide command type and structure recommendations

## Success Metrics

### Information Quality
- **Completeness**: >90% of essential information captured
- **Accuracy**: >95% of extracted information validated as correct
- **Relevance**: >85% of information used in subsequent generation

### Time Efficiency
- **Target Duration**: 20-30 minutes total consultation time
- **Smart Defaults Savings**: 15-25% time reduction through intelligent inference
- **Stage Balance**: No stage exceeds 35% of total time

### User Experience
- **Engagement Rating**: >4.0/5.0 for conversation quality
- **Value Perception**: >4.5/5.0 for time investment value
- **Control Satisfaction**: >4.0/5.0 for user control and navigation

### Technical Effectiveness
