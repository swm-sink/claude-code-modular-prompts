## Project Identity

### Core Project Information
**Project Name**: TaskFlow Pro
**Domain**: Productivity
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Development Stage**: Established

### Mission & Vision
**Mission**: TaskFlow Pro streamlines task management and team collaboration for small to medium businesses by providing an intuitive platform with smart prioritization and real-time collaboration features.

**Primary Goals**:
- Improve user engagement by 40% this year
- Expand to mobile platform within 6 months  
- Enhance real-time collaboration features
- Build API ecosystem for integrations

**Target Users**: Small to medium businesses and their teams

### Value Propositions
- Intuitive task management with smart prioritization
- Real-time team collaboration features
- Seamless integration with existing tools

## Architectural Philosophy

### Design Principles
- **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize user experience and workflow efficiency over feature complexity
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Enable seamless team communication and live updates
- **Integration-First**: Build with API ecosystem and third-party integrations as core architecture
- **Performance-Conscious**: Maintain fast loading times and responsive interfaces
- **Security by Design**: Implement security controls from the ground up, not as afterthoughts

### Technology Philosophy
**Core Technology Stack**: React/TypeScript SPA with Node.js microservices backend

**Technology Rationale**:
The team chose React/TypeScript for its component-based architecture that scales well with team size, strong type safety for reduced bugs, and excellent ecosystem for productivity tooling. The microservices backend approach enables independent scaling and deployment of different system components.

### Scalability & Performance Priorities
**Scalability Approach**: Horizontal scaling with microservices architecture and containerized deployment

**Performance Priorities**:
- First Contentful Paint < 2 seconds
- Time to Interactive < 3 seconds  
- Mobile-responsive design supporting 3G networks
- Real-time updates with minimal latency

**Quality Focus Areas**:
- Type safety through comprehensive TypeScript usage
- Automated testing with 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% e2e coverage
- Code review requirements for all changes
- Security compliance (OAuth 2.0, GDPR, SOC 2 Type II preparation)

## Team Culture & Working Agreements

### Team Structure
**Team Size**: 6 (midpoint of 5-8 developers)
**Team Composition**: Medium team (frontend, backend, QA, PM)
**Expertise Level**: Experienced (established product with 2,500+ active teams)

### Communication Patterns
**Communication Style**: Professional but collaborative
**Meeting Cadence**: Agile with Scrum ceremonies
**Decision-Making Process**: Consensus-driven with technical lead final authority

### Working Agreements
- All code requires peer review before merge
- Security-first mindset with regular dependency updates
- Documentation maintained alongside code changes
- Sprint planning with clear goals and capacity-based assignments
- Daily standups focused on blockers and collaboration needs

**Knowledge Sharing**: Code-adjacent documentation with centralized architecture docs in Notion

## Historical Context & Evolution

### Project Timeline
**Project Started**: ~2022 (inferred from established status with v2.1)

**Key Milestones**:
- **v1.0**: Initial product launch and market validation
- **v2.0**: Major architectural improvements and feature expansion
- **v2.1**: Current version with 2,500+ active teams

### Major Decisions & Pivots
#### Technology Stack Modernization
**Context**: Growing team size and complexity requirements
**Decision**: Migrated to TypeScript and microservices architecture
**Rationale**: Improved type safety, better developer experience, and independent service scaling
**Impact**: Reduced bugs in production, improved development velocity

#### Integration-First Strategy
**Context**: Customer demand for tool ecosystem connectivity  
**Decision**: Prioritize API development and third-party integrations
**Rationale**: 90% of teams use Slack, need seamless workflow integration
**Impact**: Higher user adoption and retention rates

### Lessons Learned
- **Technical Debt**: Legacy code in user management system is slowing feature development - prioritize incremental refactoring
- **Quality Processes**: Inconsistent testing practices led to production bugs - standardized testing requirements across team
- **User Retention**: Customer churn after trial period indicates onboarding issues - focus on user journey optimization

## Core Constraints & Principles

### Technical Constraints
- **Browser Support**: Must support IE11 for enterprise clients
- **Performance**: First Contentful Paint < 2 seconds for user retention
- **Real-time Requirements**: Sub-second update propagation for collaboration features

### Business Constraints
- **Compliance**: GDPR compliance required for EU expansion plans
- **Enterprise Requirements**: SOC 2 Type II compliance preparation for enterprise sales
- **Mobile Performance**: Must function effectively on 3G networks for global accessibility

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 + JWT authentication, data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Scalability**: Support 10x current user base with horizontal scaling approach
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime SLA for paid plans
- **Performance**: Sub-3-second Time to Interactive across all supported browsers

## Current Challenges & Aspirations

### Primary Pain Points
- **Technical**: Legacy code in user management system
  - *Impact*: Slowing down feature development and creating maintenance burden
- **Process**: Inconsistent testing across team members  
  - *Impact*: Bugs making it to production, affecting user trust
- **Business**: Customer churn after trial period
  - *Impact*: Revenue growth plateau and increased acquisition costs

### Success Criteria (6-month outlook)
- 40% increase in daily active users
- Mobile app launch with feature parity to web platform
- API marketplace with 10+ integrations
- Reduce bug reports by 60%

### Aspirational Goals
- Become the leading collaboration platform for SMBs
- Expand internationally to EU and APAC markets
- Build a thriving ecosystem of third-party integrations
