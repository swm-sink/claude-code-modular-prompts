# Claude Context Architect - Deep Discovery Architecture

## Vision: 30-60 Minute Deep Discovery Consultation System

This architecture houses a comprehensive 30-60 minute deep discovery consultation system that transforms Claude Code from a generic assistant into YOUR specialized project expert through depth, research, and quality over speed.

## The Fundamental Pivot: Depth Over Speed

**‚ùå What We Replaced (30-Second Smart Onboarding)**:
- Speed-focused assumptions without validation
- Generic templates that don't fit specific projects  
- Zero-question onboarding that misses project nuance
- Command templates instead of project-specific solutions
- Basic configuration instead of context engineering

**‚úÖ What We're Building (30-60 Minute Deep Discovery)**:
- Research-based patterns from analyzing 20+ leading repositories
- Interactive consultation with smart, valuable questions (20-30 minutes)
- Multi-file hierarchical context engineering that captures project DNA
- Real specialized agents developed for your specific domain
- Project-specific command generation based on actual discoveries
- Evidence-based approach with 3+ source validation

## Architecture Overview: The 8-Phase Journey
