# Command Forge Directory - Project-Specific Command Generation Engine

## Purpose: Generate Commands Tailored to Your Project Conventions

This directory houses the command generation engine that creates project-specific commands based on discovered patterns and conventions, replacing generic templates with commands that understand and follow your project's specific approaches.

## How This Differs from Speed-Focused Approach

**❌ Speed Approach**: Generic command templates that ignore project conventions
**✅ Depth Approach**: Project-specific commands generated from your actual patterns

### Speed vs Depth Philosophy
- **Speed**: "Here are commands that work generically" → Misaligned with your conventions
- **Depth**: "Here are commands that work like YOUR project" → Perfect fit with your patterns

## Command Generation Methodology: Project-Specific vs Generic

### Traditional Approach (Generic Templates):
1. One-size-fits-all command templates
2. Generic parameter handling
3. No understanding of project conventions

### Project-Specific Generation Approach:
1. **Pattern Analysis**: Extract command patterns from your existing project
2. **Convention Mapping**: Understand and follow your established conventions
3. **Context Integration**: Commands understand your project structure and patterns
4. **Dynamic Generation**: Commands adapt to your specific needs and preferences
5. **Validation Testing**: Generated commands tested against your project requirements
