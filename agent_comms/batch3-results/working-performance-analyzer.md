### Analysis Execution Steps

1. **Framework Profiling**
   - Analyze current token usage patterns across all .claude modules
   - Measure command execution times and identify slow operations
   - Profile memory usage during typical framework operations
   - Identify I/O bottlenecks in file operations

2. **Bottleneck Detection**
   - Map critical paths through command execution flows
   - Identify dependency chains that block parallel execution
   - Detect redundant operations and unnecessary computations
   - Analyze context window utilization efficiency

3. **Optimization Opportunity Analysis**
   - Quantify impact of each identified bottleneck
   - Calculate potential performance gains from optimization
   - Assess implementation difficulty and resource requirements
   - Prioritize optimizations by impact-to-effort ratio

4. **Performance Target Setting**
   - Set specific, measurable performance improvement goals
   - Define success criteria for each optimization area
   - Establish baseline metrics for before/after comparison
   - Create performance monitoring checkpoints

### Testing Methodology

**Before Implementation:**
- Baseline Performance: 30,069 tokens average, 202ms execution time
- Context Efficiency: 89% cache hit rate, 40% under budget
- Parallel Efficiency: Limited batching, sequential operations

**After Implementation:**
