## Core Components

### 1. Complexity Analyzer

**Purpose:** Assess task complexity to select optimal routing and thinking modes.

```typescript
interface ComplexityAnalyzer {
  analyzeTask(input: string, context: SessionContext): ComplexityScore;
  determineThinkingMode(complexity: ComplexityScore): ThinkingMode;
  selectExecutionStrategy(complexity: ComplexityScore): ExecutionStrategy;
}

interface ComplexityScore {
  overall: number;        // 1-10 overall complexity
  dimensions: {
    cognitive: number;    // Reasoning complexity
    technical: number;    // Implementation complexity
    scope: number;        // Multi-component scope
    uncertainty: number;  // Ambiguity level
  };
  indicators: {
    multiStep: boolean;
    requiresTools: boolean;
    crossSession: boolean;
    highStakes: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Complexity Decision Matrix:**

| Complexity | Thinking Mode | Execution | Target Commands |
|------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1-2 | Instant | Sequential | `/task` (simple) |
| 3-5 | Standard | Parallel | `/task` (complex), `/feature` (small) |
| 6-8 | Extended | Orchestrated | `/feature`, `/swarm` (focused) |
| 9-10 | Ultrathink | Multi-agent | `/swarm` (complex), `/protocol` |

### 2. Intent Recognition Engine

**Purpose:** Translate natural language input into structured command intents.

```typescript
interface IntentRecognizer {
  parseIntent(input: string): ParsedIntent;
  extractEntities(input: string): Entity[];
  resolveAmbiguity(intent: ParsedIntent, context: SessionContext): ResolvedIntent;
}

interface ParsedIntent {
  primary_action: ActionType;
  entities: Entity[];
  modifiers: Modifier[];
  confidence: number;
  alternatives: AlternativeIntent[];
}

enum ActionType {
  CREATE = "create",
  MODIFY = "modify", 
  ANALYZE = "analyze",
  DEPLOY = "deploy",
  TEST = "test",
  DEBUG = "debug",
  OPTIMIZE = "optimize",
  DOCUMENT = "document"
}
```

**Intent Pattern Examples:**

```yaml
intent_patterns:
  creation:
    - "create a new [entity]"
    - "implement [feature]"
    - "build [component]"
    - "add [functionality]"
    
  analysis:
    - "analyze [target]"
    - "review [code]"
    - "examine [system]"
    - "understand [codebase]"
    
  modification:
    - "update [target]"
    - "fix [issue]"
    - "optimize [component]"
    - "refactor [code]"
    
  orchestration:
    - "help me [complex_task]"
    - "coordinate [workflow]"
    - "manage [project]"
    - "automate [process]"
```

### 3. Command Router

**Purpose:** Map resolved intents to optimal command execution paths.

```typescript
interface CommandRouter {
  route(intent: ResolvedIntent, complexity: ComplexityScore): RoutingDecision;
  validateRoute(decision: RoutingDecision): ValidationResult;
  optimizeExecution(decision: RoutingDecision): OptimizedExecution;
}

interface RoutingDecision {
  primary_command: string;
  execution_mode: ExecutionMode;
  thinking_mode: ThinkingMode;
  parameters: CommandParameters;
  fallback_options: FallbackOption[];
  estimated_duration: TimeEstimate;
}

enum ExecutionMode {
  DIRECT = "direct",           // Single command execution
  SEQUENTIAL = "sequential",   // Multiple commands in order
  PARALLEL = "parallel",       // Simultaneous execution
  ORCHESTRATED = "orchestrated" // Complex workflow management
}
```

**Routing Logic:**

```yaml
routing_rules:
  single_file_tasks:
    complexity: 1-3
    target: "/task"
    thinking: "instant"
    execution: "direct"
    
  multi_component_features:
    complexity: 4-6
    target: "/feature" 
    thinking: "standard"
    execution: "parallel"
    
  complex_analysis:
    complexity: 3-7
    target: "/query"
    thinking: "extended"
    execution: "sequential"
    
  orchestrated_workflows:
    complexity: 7-10
    target: "/swarm"
    thinking: "ultrathink"
    execution: "orchestrated"
    
  production_deployment:
    complexity: 8-10
    target: "/protocol"
    thinking: "extended"
    execution: "orchestrated"
```

### 4. Context Manager

**Purpose:** Maintain session state and project awareness for intelligent routing decisions.

```typescript
interface ContextManager {
  getCurrentContext(): SessionContext;
  updateContext(event: ContextEvent): void;
  persistContext(): void;
  loadPersistedContext(): SessionContext;
}

interface SessionContext {
  project: ProjectInfo;
  user_preferences: UserPreferences;
  command_history: CommandHistory[];
  current_goals: Goal[];
  session_state: SessionState;
  performance_metrics: PerformanceData;
}

interface ProjectInfo {
  type: ProjectType;
  languages: string[];
  frameworks: string[];
  complexity: ProjectComplexity;
  current_branch: string;
  recent_changes: Change[];
}
```

**Context-Aware Routing Examples:**

```yaml
context_routing:
  project_context:
    new_project:
      prefer: ["/init", "/task"]
      avoid: ["/swarm", "/protocol"]
    
    active_development:
      prefer: ["/task", "/feature"]
      optimize_for: "speed"
    
    production_deployment:
      prefer: ["/protocol"]
      require: "extended_thinking"
  
  user_context:
    beginner:
      progressive_disclosure: true
      confirmation_required: true
      
    expert:
      progressive_disclosure: false
      parallel_execution: true
```

## Claude 4 Integration

### 1. Thinking Mode Selector

**Purpose:** Optimize Claude 4's thinking modes based on task requirements.

```typescript
interface ThinkingModeSelector {
  selectMode(complexity: ComplexityScore, context: SessionContext): ThinkingConfig;
  adaptMode(currentMode: ThinkingConfig, feedback: ExecutionFeedback): ThinkingConfig;
}

interface ThinkingConfig {
  mode: ThinkingMode;
  token_budget: number;
  interleaved: boolean;
  parallel_tools: boolean;
  quality_threshold: number;
}

enum ThinkingMode {
  INSTANT = "instant",           // <100ms, 0 thinking tokens
  STANDARD = "standard",         // 200ms-1s, 1K-8K tokens  
  EXTENDED = "extended",         // 1-3s, 8K-32K tokens
  ULTRATHINK = "ultrathink"      // 3s+, full allocation
}
```

**Mode Selection Logic:**

```yaml
thinking_mode_selection:
  instant_triggers:
    - complexity <= 2
    - simple_queries
    - autocomplete_requests
    - cached_responses
    
  standard_triggers:
    - complexity 3-5
    - moderate_reasoning
    - single_tool_usage
    - familiar_patterns
    
  extended_triggers:
    - complexity 6-8
    - deep_analysis
    - multi_tool_orchestration
    - novel_problems
    
  ultrathink_triggers:
    - complexity 9-10
    - research_tasks
    - complex_debugging
    - architecture_design
    - explicit_request
```

### 2. Parallel Executor

**Purpose:** Leverage Claude 4's parallel tool execution for optimal performance.

```typescript
interface ParallelExecutor {
  identifyParallelOperations(command: Command): ParallelPlan;
  executeParallel(plan: ParallelPlan): ParallelResult;
  handleParallelErrors(errors: ExecutionError[]): ErrorResolution;
}

interface ParallelPlan {
  independent_operations: Operation[];
  dependent_chains: OperationChain[];
  synchronization_points: SyncPoint[];
  estimated_speedup: number;
}
```

**Parallel Execution Patterns:**

```yaml
parallel_patterns:
  multi_file_analysis:
    - read_files: "parallel"
    - analyze_content: "parallel" 
    - synthesize_results: "sequential"
    
  feature_development:
    - create_components: "parallel"
    - write_tests: "parallel"
    - update_docs: "parallel"
    - integration: "sequential"
    
  deployment_preparation:
    - run_tests: "parallel"
    - build_artifacts: "sequential"
    - security_scan: "parallel"
    - deploy: "sequential"
```

### 3. Memory System

**Purpose:** Utilize Claude 4's persistent memory for cross-session continuity.

```typescript
interface MemorySystem {
  saveContext(context: SessionContext): void;
  loadContext(sessionId: string): SessionContext;
  updateLearnings(execution: ExecutionResult): void;
  getRelevantHistory(intent: ResolvedIntent): HistoryContext;
}

interface MemoryFiles {
  session_context: "session_state.json";
  user_preferences: "user_config.json";
  project_patterns: "patterns_db.json";
  performance_history: "metrics_history.json";
  learned_optimizations: "optimization_cache.json";
}
```

## UX Enhancement Patterns

### 1. Progressive Disclosure

**Purpose:** Reveal complexity gradually based on user expertise and task requirements.

```typescript
interface ProgressiveDisclosure {
  determineDisclosureLevel(user: UserProfile, task: TaskInfo): DisclosureLevel;
  presentOptions(options: RoutingOptions, level: DisclosureLevel): UserPresentation;
  handleUserSelection(selection: UserChoice): RoutingDecision;
}

enum DisclosureLevel {
  MINIMAL = "minimal",         // Single best option
  GUIDED = "guided",           // 2-3 options with guidance
  COMPREHENSIVE = "comprehensive", // All options with details
  EXPERT = "expert"            // Raw technical details
}
```

**Disclosure Examples:**

```yaml
disclosure_patterns:
  minimal:
    presentation: "I'll help you [task_description]. Proceeding with [command]..."
    confirmation: false
    details: false
    
  guided:
    presentation: |
      I can help you [task_description] in a few ways:
      1. [Option 1] - Quick and simple
      2. [Option 2] - More comprehensive 
      3. [Option 3] - Full featured
      
      Which approach would you prefer?
    
  comprehensive:
    presentation: |
      Task Analysis:
      - Complexity: [score]/10
      - Estimated time: [duration]
      - Required tools: [tools]
      
      Available approaches:
      [Detailed options with pros/cons]
      
  expert:
    presentation: |
      Raw routing decision:
      - Intent: [parsed_intent]
      - Complexity: [detailed_score]
      - Recommended: [command] with [parameters]
      - Alternatives: [alternatives]
      - Thinking mode: [mode] ([reasoning])
```

### 2. Progress Feedback

**Purpose:** Provide visual feedback for long-running operations and complex workflows.

```typescript
interface ProgressFeedback {
  startProgress(operation: Operation): ProgressHandle;
  updateProgress(handle: ProgressHandle, status: ProgressStatus): void;
  completeProgress(handle: ProgressHandle, result: OperationResult): void;
}

interface ProgressStatus {
  stage: string;
  completion: number;
  current_action: string;
  estimated_remaining: Duration;
  can_cancel: boolean;
}
```

**Progress Patterns:**

```yaml
progress_patterns:
  spinner:
    use_case: "Unknown duration operations"
    format: "⠋ [action]..."
    update_frequency: "100ms"
    
  counter:
    use_case: "Countable operations"
    format: "[action] ([current]/[total])"
    update_frequency: "per_item"
    
  progress_bar:
    use_case: "Measurable progress"
    format: "[action] [████████░░░░░░] [percentage]%"
    update_frequency: "5%_increments"
    
  stage_indicator:
    use_case: "Multi-stage workflows"
    format: |
      Workflow Progress:
      1. Analysis ✓
      2. Planning ⏳
      3. Execution ⏸
      4. Validation ⏸
```

### 3. Error Recovery

**Purpose:** Provide intelligent error handling with contextual guidance and recovery options.

```typescript
interface ErrorRecovery {
  analyzeError(error: ExecutionError, context: ExecutionContext): ErrorAnalysis;
  generateRecoveryOptions(analysis: ErrorAnalysis): RecoveryOption[];
  executeRecovery(option: RecoveryOption): RecoveryResult;
}

interface ErrorAnalysis {
  error_type: ErrorType;
  root_cause: string;
  impact_assessment: ImpactLevel;
  recovery_difficulty: DifficultyLevel;
  similar_cases: HistoricalCase[];
}

interface RecoveryOption {
  strategy: RecoveryStrategy;
  description: string;
  success_probability: number;
  required_actions: Action[];
  estimated_time: Duration;
}
```

**Error Recovery Patterns:**

```yaml
error_recovery:
  command_not_found:
    analysis: "Intent recognition failed"
    suggestions:
      - "Did you mean: [similar_commands]"
      - "Try: /help [topic]"
      - "Available commands: [list]"
    
  insufficient_context:
    analysis: "Missing project or session context"
    suggestions:
      - "Initialize project: /init"
      - "Provide more details about [missing_info]"
      - "Check project status: /query status"
    
  complexity_mismatch:
    analysis: "Task complexity exceeds selected command capabilities"
    suggestions:
      - "Try /swarm for complex workflows"
      - "Break down into smaller tasks"
      - "Use /feature for multi-component work"
    
  execution_failure:
    analysis: "Command execution failed during [stage]"
    suggestions:
      - "Retry with different approach"
      - "Check [specific_requirements]"
      - "Fall back to manual steps"
```
