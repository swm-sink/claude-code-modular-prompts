# Pattern Optimizer - WORKING PROMPT

## MISSION
Optimize patterns for performance and token efficiency

## EXECUTE THIS PROMPT
```
I need to optimize my pattern system for maximum performance and efficiency. Current system has performance issues.

CURRENT PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS:
- Pattern loading time: Too slow
- Token usage: Too high
- Memory consumption: Excessive
- Context overflow: Frequent
- Success rate: Below target

OPTIMIZATION TARGETS:
- Execution time: <2 minutes per pattern
- Token usage: <4K tokens per pattern
- Memory efficiency: <100MB RAM usage
- Success rate: >95% completion rate
- Context overflow: <5% of sessions

APPLY OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
1. Parallel execution: Batch tool calls for 70% performance improvement
2. Context compression: XML structure optimization
3. Lazy loading: Load patterns only when needed
4. Caching: Cache frequently used patterns
5. Token efficiency: Eliminate redundant content
6. Memory management: Optimize data structures

MEASURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Before vs after benchmarks
- Performance metrics comparison
- Token usage analysis
- Memory consumption tracking
- Success rate validation

PROVIDE:
- Optimization strategy
- Performance benchmarks
- Implementation plan
- Validation metrics
- Rollback procedures

DELIVER IMMEDIATELY ACTIONABLE OPTIMIZATION PLAN.
