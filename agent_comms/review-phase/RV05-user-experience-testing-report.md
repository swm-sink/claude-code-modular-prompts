## Recommendations

### Critical Priority (Address within 1 week)
1. **Reduce Initial Cognitive Load**: Create guided tutorial introducing concepts progressively
   - Start with /auto and /task only
   - Gradually introduce /feature, /query, /swarm
   - Defer meta-operations until user is comfortable

### High Priority (Address within 1 month)
1. **Improve Error Message Accessibility**: 
   - Translate technical errors to user-friendly language
   - Add more recovery suggestions for system errors

2. **Create Progressive Learning Path**:
   - Interactive tutorial in GETTING_STARTED.md
   - Staged complexity introduction
   - Checkpoint validation at each learning stage

### Medium Priority (Address within 3 months)
1. **Enhance Command Discovery**: Add command recommendation engine based on user patterns
2. **Improve Documentation Search**: Add keyword indexing and search functionality
3. **Create Visual Workflow Guides**: Flowcharts for common development scenarios
4. **Add User Onboarding Validation**: Automated checks for successful framework adoption

### Low Priority (Address within 6 months)
1. **Develop Interactive Help System**: Context-sensitive help within commands
2. **Create User Preference Learning**: Adapt command suggestions based on usage patterns
3. **Add Usage Analytics**: Track user success patterns to improve UX
4. **Develop Mobile-Friendly Documentation**: Responsive design for mobile access
