## 1. Mutation Testing Revolution for AI Systems

### Meta's Automated Compliance Hardening (ACH)
**Source**: [Meta Engineering Blog - Feb 2025](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/02/05/security/revolutionizing-software-testing-llm-powered-bug-catchers-meta-ach/)

Meta's ACH represents the first large-scale industrial deployment combining LLM-based test generation with mutation testing. The system generates undetected faults (mutants) specific to areas of concern and automatically creates tests to catch these faults.

**Key Innovation**: Mutation-guided LLM test generation that hardens platforms against regressions by focusing on realistic concern areas rather than random mutations.

**Performance Metrics**:
- Successfully deployed across Meta's production systems
- Combines two previously separate techniques at industrial scale
- Generates tests for compliance-critical code paths

### MuTAP Framework 
**Source**: [University of Michigan Research - 2024](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~movaghar/Mutation%20Testing%20LLM%202025.pdf)

MuTAP (Mutation Test case generation using Augmented Prompt) improves test case effectiveness by leveraging mutation testing to augment prompts with surviving mutants.

**Performance Results**:
- **93.57% Mutation Score** on synthetic buggy code
- **28% more faulty code detection** compared to traditional methods  
- **17% unique fault detection** not found by state-of-the-art tools (Pynguin) or zero-shot LLM approaches

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
# MuTAP Workflow
1. Generate initial test for code portion
2. Perform mutation testing on generated test
3. Identify surviving mutants
4. Augment prompt with surviving mutant information
5. Generate new assertions for each surviving mutant
6. Add enhanced assertions to test suite
```

## 2. Coverage-Guided Testing Frameworks
