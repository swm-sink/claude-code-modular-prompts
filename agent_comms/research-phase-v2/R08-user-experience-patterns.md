## UX Patterns Catalog

### 1. Command Discoverability Patterns

**Help System Integration**
```bash
# Pattern: Comprehensive help at multiple levels
tool --help                 # Overview and common commands
tool command --help         # Command-specific help
tool command subcommand --help  # Detailed parameter help
```

**Progressive Command Structure**
```bash
# Pattern: Verb-noun consistency (Git/Docker style)
tool user create            # Clear action-object relationship
tool project deploy         # Predictable command hierarchy
tool config set             # Intuitive parameter management
```

**Example-Driven Discovery**
```bash
# Pattern: Help text with practical examples
$ tool deploy --help
Deploy your application to production

USAGE:
  tool deploy [OPTIONS] <environment>

EXAMPLES:
  tool deploy staging --rollback-on-fail
  tool deploy production --no-downtime
  tool deploy dev --watch-logs
```

### 2. Error Handling Patterns

**Contextual Error Messages**
```bash
# Bad: Cryptic error
Error: Invalid input

# Good: Helpful context with suggestions
Error: Invalid environment 'prod'
  
Did you mean one of these?
  - production
  - staging
  - development

Run 'tool environments list' to see all available environments.
```

**Visual Error Indicators**
- Red border/background for error sections
- Exclamation mark icons for accessibility
- Consistent error placement (under affected input)
- Progressive error detail disclosure

**Recovery Guidance**
```bash
# Pattern: Next steps after error
Error: Configuration file not found

To fix this:
1. Run 'tool init' to create a new config
2. Or specify config with --config /path/to/config
3. See 'tool config --help' for more options
```

### 3. Progress Feedback Patterns

**Spinner Pattern**
```bash
# For unknown duration tasks
‚†ã Installing dependencies...
‚†ô Installing dependencies...
‚†π Installing dependencies...
```

**X/Y Progress Pattern**
```bash
# For countable operations
Installing dependencies (3/12)
Building components (8/15)
Running tests (25/40)
```

**Progress Bar Pattern**
```bash
# For measurable progress
Uploading files [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 60% (120MB/200MB)
```

### 4. AI Interface Patterns

**Intent Recognition**
```bash
# Pattern: Natural language to command translation
$ ai "deploy my app to staging"
‚Üí Translated to: tool deploy staging
‚Üí Execute? [y/N]
```

**Context Awareness**
```bash
# Pattern: Maintaining conversation context
$ ai "create a new user"
Created user 'john.doe'. What would you like to do next?

$ ai "assign admin privileges"
‚Üí Understanding: assign admin to user 'john.doe'
‚Üí Execute: tool user grant-role john.doe admin
```

**Tool Orchestration**
```bash
# Pattern: Multi-step AI workflows
$ ai "prepare release v2.1.0"
Planning release workflow:
1. Run tests ‚úì
2. Update version ‚úì
3. Build artifacts ‚è≥
4. Tag release ‚è∏
5. Deploy staging ‚è∏

Continue with step 3? [y/N]
```

### 5. Onboarding Patterns

**Progressive Disclosure**
```bash
# Level 1: Basic command
$ tool init
Project initialized! Try 'tool status' to see what's next.

# Level 2: Guided discovery
$ tool status
Project ready for deployment.

Next steps:
  ‚Ä¢ Add environment: tool env add staging <url>
  ‚Ä¢ Configure CI/CD: tool ci setup
  ‚Ä¢ Deploy: tool deploy staging

Run any command with --help for detailed options.
```

**Interactive Setup**
```bash
# Pattern: Guided configuration
$ tool setup
Welcome to MyTool! Let's get you set up.

? What's your project name? my-awesome-app
? Which framework are you using? 
  > React
    Vue
    Angular
    Other

? Enable automatic deployments? (y/N) y

‚úì Configuration saved to .mytool.yml
‚úì Ready to deploy! Run 'tool deploy' when ready.
```

**Just-in-Time Learning**
```bash
# Pattern: Contextual tips
$ tool deploy --complex-flag
üí° Tip: The --complex-flag enables advanced features.

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Command Structure Design

**Hierarchy Planning**
1. Define primary verbs (create, deploy, configure, etc.)
2. Group related actions under common prefixes
3. Maintain consistent parameter patterns
4. Plan help text hierarchy

**Example Structure:**
```
tool
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ delete
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ list
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ status
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ set
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ get
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ list
```

### 2. Error Handling Implementation

**Error Message Template**
```
[CONTEXT] What went wrong
[CAUSE] Why it happened (if helpful)
[SOLUTION] What to do next
[REFERENCE] Where to get more help
```

**Error Recovery Flow**
1. Detect error condition
2. Provide immediate context
3. Suggest specific remediation
4. Offer additional resources
5. Enable easy retry/continuation

### 3. Progress Feedback Implementation

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Spinner**: Unknown duration, indeterminate progress
- **X/Y Format**: Countable items, clear total
- **Progress Bar**: Measurable percentage, file operations

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Update frequency (avoid excessive redraws)
- Graceful degradation in non-interactive terminals
- Cancellation handling (Ctrl+C)
- Error state handling during progress

### 4. AI Integration Patterns

**Hybrid Approach Design**
1. Start with traditional CLI commands
2. Add AI interpretation layer
3. Provide command preview/confirmation
4. Maintain traditional escape hatches
5. Learn from user preferences

**Context Management**
```typescript
interface AIContext {
  previousCommands: string[];
  currentProject: ProjectInfo;
  userPreferences: UserPrefs;
  sessionGoals: string[];
}
```

### 5. Documentation Integration

**Multi-Level Help System**
```bash
# Top level: Overview and navigation
tool --help

# Command level: Specific usage
tool deploy --help

# Interactive examples
tool examples deploy

# Full documentation
tool docs deploy
```

**Contextual Documentation**
- Inline examples in help text
- Related command suggestions
- Error-specific documentation links
- Progressive detail levels

## Conclusion

The research reveals that CLI and AI interface UX has evolved significantly in 2024-2025, moving from traditional UNIX-centric approaches to human-centered design principles. Modern interfaces prioritize:

1. **Discoverability** through comprehensive help systems and consistent command structures
2. **Progressive disclosure** to manage cognitive load while enabling expert workflows
3. **Intelligent error handling** with contextual guidance and recovery suggestions
4. **Hybrid AI integration** that enhances rather than replaces traditional CLI patterns
5. **Visual design principles** adapted for terminal environments

The most successful implementations combine traditional CLI efficiency with modern UX expectations, creating tools that are both powerful for experts and accessible to newcomers. The key is recognizing that developer tools deserve the same UX attention as consumer applications while respecting the unique constraints and advantages of command-line environments.

**Recommendations for Implementation:**
- Start with solid CLI fundamentals before adding AI features
- Prioritize help systems and error handling over complex features
- Use progressive disclosure to reveal complexity gradually
- Implement visual feedback patterns appropriate for terminal environments
- Test with both novice and expert users throughout development

The future of CLI/AI interfaces lies in thoughtful integration of AI capabilities with proven command-line patterns, creating tools that amplify human productivity while maintaining the speed and precision that make CLI tools invaluable to developers.
