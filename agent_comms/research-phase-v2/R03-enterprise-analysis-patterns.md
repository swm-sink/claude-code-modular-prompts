Modern enterprises face the challenge of analyzing massive codebases with thousands of repositories. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems have emerged as the solution, enabling:

- **Semantic Search**: Identification of relevant repositories through metadata and high-level content analysis
- **Microservice Architecture Mapping**: Automated discovery of service dependencies and interactions
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Understanding code in the broader ecosystem context

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
class EnterpriseRAGAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, codebase_scale):
        self.repository_count = codebase_scale
        self.semantic_indexer = SemanticCodeIndexer()
        self.dependency_mapper = DependencyAnalyzer()
    
    def analyze_codebase(self, query):
        # Semantic search across 10k+ repos
        relevant_repos = self.semantic_indexer.search(
            query, 
            top_k=50,
            threshold=0.8
        )
        
        # Map dependencies and interactions
        dependency_graph = self.dependency_mapper.map_relations(relevant_repos)
