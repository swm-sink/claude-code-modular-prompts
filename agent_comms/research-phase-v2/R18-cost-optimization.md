## ROI Calculation Methodologies

### Cost Reduction ROI Formula
```
Cost Reduction ROI = (Baseline Costs - Optimized Costs) / Optimization Investment * 100

Example:
- Baseline monthly AI costs: $100,000
- Optimized monthly costs: $40,000
- Optimization investment: $20,000
- ROI = ($100,000 - $40,000) / $20,000 * 100 = 300%
```

### Time to Value Calculation
```
Time to Value = Deployment Date - Initiative Start Date

Typical AI optimization Time to Value: 1-3 months
Leading performers achieving <30 days for basic optimizations
```

### Total Cost of Ownership Model
```
AI TCO = Infrastructure + Platform + Development + Operations + Support

Cost Optimization Impact:
- Infrastructure: 40-90% reduction via resource optimization
- Platform: 30-70% reduction via model selection
- Development: 20-50% reduction via prompt engineering
